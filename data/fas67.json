Fuel ethanol consumption in\n2016 is estimated at 1.3 billion liters (average national blend rate of E12.4) and has been growing at a\nrate far below the pace required to meet the target of 3.3 billion liters set for 2021. Biodiesel\nconsumption in 2016 is also estimated at 1.3 billion liters with a calculated on-road use of B5.7. This is\nbelow the current mandatory B7.\n\n\u000cPost:\nBangkok\n\nI. Executive Summary\nIn October 2015, the Thai Cabinet approved Thailand’s revised national energy plan, consisting of 3\nplans; i.e., Alternative Energy Development Plan: AEDP 2015-2036, Oil Plan 2015-2036, and Gas Plan\n2015-2036. The plan revision is intended to align with the 11th National Economic and Social\nDevelopment Plan. The bottom line of the revised AEDP is to promote higher use of biofuels and while\nremaining self-reliant in feedstock and biofuels with minimum to trade for both. The plan also aims at\nexpediting the mandatory blending the current B7 requirement to B10 in 2018. The Government plans\nto subsidize the use of B20 in large trucks on a voluntary basis, beginning in 2016. However, the\naccomplishment of higher blends under this mandatory requirement plan may be difficult to reach or\nsustain given the volatile weather-driven production of palm oil, which is an only domestic biodiesel\nfeedstock if the market remains closed to foreign feedstock and biodiesel. Thailand’s campaign to\nutilize used cooking oil for biodiesel production exists among one or two biodiesel companies as a\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CRS) campaign but the use is limited to 5-6 million liters of unused\ncooking oil per annum. Regarding ethanol policy, the government is still promoting the ethanol use\nthrough price incentives and excise tax reduction for cars compatible with E20 and E85 gasohol.\nIn 2017, fuel ethanol production and consumption should continue to increase to 1.4 billion liters,\nsupported equally through price incentives to the State Oil Fund and market incentives to retailers. The\nprice subsidies, which are paid by the State Oil Fund, make gasohol (ethanol-blended gasoline) 20 to 40\npercent cheaper than regular gasoline.\nAlthough the government’s policy is to maintain its B7 mandates in 2016 and 2017, it possibly restate a\nstep-down in biodiesel mandates at any time following weather-vulnerable palm oil supplies. Lately in\n2016, the government announced to lower B7 mandates to B5, effective on July 25, 2016 because palm\noil supplies appeared to be lower than earlier estimates, and if the mandates continue, soaring palm oil\nprices would negatively affect household cooking palm oil consumers.\nThe significant decline in diesel prices in 2015 not only encouraged diesel vehicle users (mainly trucks\nor trailers) to switch to diesel from CNG, but it also stimulates increased use of diesel among smaller\nvehicles (i.e., pick-up trucks). As a result, biodiesel consumption rose by 4 percent growth to 1.23\nbillion liters in 2015, as compared to 1.18 billion liters in 2014. Prevailing low prices for diesel are\nexpected to drive biodiesel consumption growth 6 percent in 2016 and 8 percent in 2017.\nII. Policy and Program\nThe 10-year Alternative Energy Development Plan (2012-2021) was approved by the Thai Cabinet and\nvalid until it was replaced by Thailand’s 20-year National Energy Plan (2015 – 2036) endorsed in\nOctober 2015 in order to align with the 11th National Economic and Social Development Plan. Like the\n2012-2021 plan, the new plan includes Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), Oil Plan, and\nGas Plan. Under the AEDP, the share of renewable and alternative energy from biofuel is aimed to\n\n\u000cincrease from 7 percent of total fuel energy use in 2015 to 25 percent in 2036. In order to accomplish\nthis energy use goal, the Thai government has targeted to increase ethanol consumption from 1.17\nbillion liters in 2015 to 4.1 billion liters by 2036, and to increase biodiesel consumption from 1.23\nbillion liters in 2015 to 5.1 billion liters by 2036.\nThe bottom line of the revised AEDP is to promote higher use of biofuels and remain self-reliant with\nrestrictions on trade in feedstocks and biofuels. Regarding ethanol policy, the government is still\npromoting the use of gasohol through price incentives and excise tax reduction for cars compatible with\nE20 and E85 gasohol. As for biodiesel policy, on the demand side, the government continues to impose\nthe mandatory blending of biodiesel in diesel markets which covers on-road, agriculture, industry, and\netc. To meet the demand, the government has targeted oil palm acreage at 10.20 million rai (1.63\nmillion hectares) by 2036 with the plan that only domestic palm oil will be used as a feedstock and other\nfeedstock like animal fats and UCO will be used insignificantly.\n\nNote: Pyrolysis oil indicated in the energy plan is mainly derived from waste plastic and old tires\n2.1 Ethanol\nThe Thai government aims to increase ethanol consumption from 1.2 billion liters in 2015 to 3.3 billion\nliters by 2021 and up to 4.1 billion liters by 2036.\n\n\u000cThe government continues to promote the use of gasohol through price incentives. The price subsidies,\nwhich are paid by the State Oil Fund, make gasohol 20 to 40 percent cheaper than regular gasoline. The\nprice subsidy rises as the blend level increases with the effect of lowering retail prices at the pump of\nhigher blend levels. In addition, the government also increased the marketing subsidies to gasoline\nstations, at around 5 baht/liter (54 US cent/gallon), to entice them to expand sales of E85 gasohol (a\nmixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline).\nThe government also supports the manufacturing of vehicles which are compatible with E20 and E85\ngasohol. The excise tax rate for Eco-cars (less than 1,300 cc engines with fuel consumption rate of no\nmore than 5 liters per 100 km.) is at 17 percent compared to 30 percent for E10 vehicles. Moreover, the\ngovernment will give an additional 3 percent reduction in the excise tax rate for the manufacturing of\nEco-cars which use E85 gasohol.\nUnder this same plan, the government expects molasses-based ethanol, which accounts for around 70\npercent of total ethanol production in 2015, to dominate Thailand’s overall ethanol production through\n2026 with molasses-based ethanol production reaching 1.8 billion liters. This is based on the Ministry\nof Agriculture and Cooperatives’ estimate that Thai sugarcane production will reach the highest\npotential at 182 million metric tons with molasses production of 8.56 million metric tons in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives foresees the increase in demand for ethanol\nfrom 2026 onward will be filled by cassava as molasses-based ethanol facilities will not be able to\nexpand any further due to limited sugarcane acreage. The cassava-based ethanol production is expected\nto increase to 2.4 billion liters by 2036 as cassava production is expected to increase to 17 million\nmetric tons in 2036, compared to 10 million metric tons in 2015. This will account for around 60\npercent of total ethanol consumption of 4.1 billion liters in 2036. Meanwhile, molasses-based ethanol\nwill account for around 40 percent of total ethanol production by 2036.\n2.2 Biodiesel\nThe Thai Government has set a biodiesel consumption target at 5.1 billion liters by 2036. The plan\nfocuses on both supply and demand.\nOn the demand side, the government continues to impose the mandatory blending of biodiesel in diesel\nfor any purpose. The plan also aims at expediting the mandatory blend rate from currently B7 to B10\nand B20. The Government plans to subsidize the use of B20 in large trucks on a voluntary basis,\nbeginning in 2016, and to commence the B10 mandatory requirement in 2018. However, the\naccomplishment of mandatory biodiesel requirement plan may not be attained given the weather-driven\nvolatility of palm oil production, the only feedstock used for biodiesel in Thailand, driven by weather\nconditions.\nOn the supply side, the government has targeted oil palm acreage at 10.20 million rai (1.63 million\nhectares) by 2036. Production of palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) is expected to reach 29.46 million metric\ntons (MMT). Out of this FFB production, 4.24 MMT of FFB would be processed as biodiesel in 2036.\nIII. Gasoline and Diesel\n\n\u000cIV. Ethanol\n4.1 Production\n\n\u000cIn 2017, fuel ethanol production is forecast to increase to 1.4 billion liters, up around 7 percent from\n2016. Molasses-based ethanol still dominates Thailand’s overall ethanol production, accounting for\naround 70 percent of fuel ethanol. The demand for molasses is expected to increase to 3.8 million\nmetric tons, up 8 percent from 2016.\nPresently, there are 21 fuel ethanol plants with production capacity of 1.5 billion liters per year.\nProduction capacity of molasses-based ethanol is currently around 0.9 billion liters per year. Other\nproducers use cassava and sugarcane as inputs with production capacity of 0.5 and 0.1 billion liters,\nrespectively.\nIn 2016, fuel ethanol production is expected to increase to around 1.3 billion liters, up 11 percent from\nthe 2015’s level. The increase is driven by growing domestic consumption of gasohol. Molasses is the\nprimary feedstock for the increased ethanol production. The demand for molasses is expected to\nincrease to 3.6 million metric tons, up around 13 percent from 3.2 million metric tons in 2015. Demand\nfor cassava increases to an estimated 2.4 million metric tons, up 8 percent from the previous year. The\ngovernment’s plan to use its own rice stocks for ethanol production to substitute for cassava is not\n\n\u000cviable as rice prices are far above cassava prices. The sole sugarcane-base ethanol plant is expected to\noperate at full capacity of around 76 million liters per year using around 1 million metric tons of\nsugarcane.\nThe production of non-fuel ethanol is controlled by the government. The Liquor Distillery\nOrganization, which is under the authority of the Excise Department of the Ministry of Finance, has a\nmonopoly on the production of industrial grade ethanol in Thailand with a production capacity of 20\nmillion liters per year. Meanwhile, domestic demand for industrial grade ethanol, particularly for\nmedical, pharmacy, paints and cosmetics uses, is around 18 million liters per year. The primary\nfeedstock for industrial ethanol production is molasses and cassava.\nPresently, fuel ethanol production capacity is at 81 percent of full capacity. Production capacity is\nexpected to reach 96 percent by 2017. Ethanol producers reportedly have received approval from the\ngovernment to expand their production capacities. However, their investment has been delayed due to\nthe concern about an economic instability.\n4.2 Consumption\nIn 2017, ethanol consumption is forecast to increase to 1.4 billion liters, up around 8 percent from 1.3\nbillion liters used in 2016. This is mainly due to growing demand for E20and E85. The demand for\nE20 and E85 will be driven by government’s price subsidies and the expansion of E20 gasohol stations.\nTotal gasohol (gasoline with ethanol blends of all levels) consumption is forecast to increase to around\n11 billion liters in 2017, up around 7 percent from an estimated 10.3 billion liters in 2016. The average\nethanol blending rate is expected to increase from 12.1 percent in 2015 to 12.6 percent in 2017.\nDuring January – May 2016, ethanol consumption totaled 568 million liters, up around 8 percent from\nthe same period last year. This is due to an increase in gasohol consumption to 4,142 million liters, up\n13 percent from the same period last year (Table 2.2). Consumption of gasohol accounted for 95\npercent of total gasoline consumption. E20 gasohol consumption also continued to increase, accounting\nfor 17 percent of total gasohol consumption due to the government price subsidies. Presently, E10 and\nE20 retail prices are 25 to 30 percent cheaper than regular gasoline. E20 retail prices are also\napproximately 10 percent cheaper than E10 gasohol. The number gasohol stations continued to increase\nnationwide to 3,105 stations for E20 and 867 stations for E85, compared to 2,836 and 678 stations in\nMay 2015, respectively.\n\n\u000c4.3. Trade\nAccording to the Thai Department of Customs, fuel ethanol is a controlled import/export product\n(HS22072011 and HS22072019). Traders must have import/export permits which will be considered by\nthe Ministry of Industry (MOI). To date, the MOI has never approved any imports of fuel ethanol into\nThailand as there are sufficient domestic supplies. Also, sources report that ethanol producers normally\nexport only ethanol for industrial uses as their facilities were originally designed to produce fuel ethanol\nfor the domestic market and they do not have the storage facilities to cover fuel export business.\n\n\u000cNon-fuel, industrial ethanol exports are likely to be minimal to zero in 2016 and 2017 due mainly to\ngrowing domestic demand for ethanol. In 2015 there were no exports of fuel ethanol. Also, exports of\nindustrial-grade ethanol were marginal at around 0.1 million liters. Meanwhile, non-fuel, industrial\nethanol imports were steady at around 11 million liters, mainly for use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic\nindustries. This accounted for less than 1 percent of total ethanol production. The Thai government\nimposes a 2.5 baht/liters duty on ethanol imports (27 US cents/gallon, based on 35.5 baht/US$, as of\nJune 30, 2016).\n4.4. Stocks\nEthanol stocks are expected to decline to around 20 million liters in 2017 in anticipation of growing\ndemand for gasohol consumption. Most fuel ethanol producers mainly supply their ethanol to domestic\nrefineries for gasohol production. Consequently, their total storage capacities are limited to only around\none month of domestic use.\nV. Biodiesel\n5.1 Production\nTable 5.1 Biodiesel Production and Use in Thailand\n\nB100 or biodiesel in Thailand is currently produced from palm oil derived feedstock such as crude palm\n\n\u000coil (CPO), refined bleached deodorized (RBD) palm oil, palm stearin, and free fatty acids of palm oil\n(FFA). Thailand’s campaign to utilize used cooking oil for biodiesel production exists among one or\ntwo biodiesel companies as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) campaign but the use is limited to\n5-6 million liters of unused cooking oil per annum. Biodiesel production is solely driven by\ngovernment mandates, mainly aimed to help palm farmers. All palm oil feedstocks used for biodiesel\nare domestic since the Government strictly controls the imports of palm oil. Meanwhile, the blending of\nbiodiesel among petroleum refineries is strictly controlled and monitored to comply with the mandatory\nrequirements. The mandatory blending of biodiesel in diesel markets covers all purposes of use\nincluding on-road, agriculture, industry, and etc.\nBiodiesel production is forecast to grow 7 percent to 1.42 billion liters in 2017 in line with an increase\nin diesel consumption and an estimated increase in the blending rates of biodiesel in diesel total use. It\nis estimated that about 70 percent of B100 is derived from RBDPO or CPO, 22 percent from palm\nstearin, and 8 percent from FFA. Given the very limited role of trade, biodiesel production in 2016 is\nforecast to grow by 12 percent from the previous year to 1.38 billion liters due to a sharp increase in\ndiesel demand driven by continued prevailing low petroleum prices against compressed natural gas\n(CNG).\nCrude palm oil supply available for domestic food, feed and industrial use plus exports is forecast to 2.3\nmillion metric tons (MMT) in MY 2016/17. CPO production is estimated to only marginally grow to\n2.1 MMT in 2015/16 from 2.07 MMT in 2014/15 due mainly to lower palm yields caused by dry\nweather conditions in 2014 and 2015.\nThe Thai Government recently turned to promote the use of lower-cost H-FAME biodiesel in\npreparation for B10 and above mandates. H-FAME is a process, developed by a Japanese research\nteam, to upgrade the quality of conventional biodiesel or fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) through partial\nhydrogenation. Trade sources reported that Global Green Chemical, a current large biodiesel producer\nin Thailand, may construct an H-FAME processing plant and launch it commercially once the B10\nmandate is imposed.\nTable 5.2 Thailand’s Production, Supply and Demand for CPO 1/\n\n\u000cDue to fierce competition between Thailand’s biodiesel processors, newcomers have been reluctant to\nenter the market since 2010. Two establishments which suspended their biodiesel production during\n2012-2014, revived their operations in 2015. As a result, all 12 producers as listed by Department of\nEnergy Business, are currently operating with an estimated total production capacity of 2.06 billion\nliters per annum. In 2015, three of the largest B100 processors in Thailand; i.e., the Global Green\nChemical Company (previously named Thai Oleochemicals), New Biodiesel Company, and the\nBangchak Biofuel Company increased their production capacities by (460 million liters per annum).\n\nTable 5.3 List of Operating B100 Producers in Thailand\n\n\u000cSource: Department of Energy Business and FAS Estimates\n\n5.2 Consumption\nIn term of the mandate administration, these mandates in the past were effective since they are applied\nto all types of diesel use as fuel and the blending of biodiesel among petroleum refineries is strictly\ncontrolled and monitored. In general, the main markets for diesel use in Thailand are on-road,\naccounting for about 60 percent of total diesel consumption, followed by agriculture at 20 percent,\nindustry 17 percent, and others 3 percent, respectively. However, due to weather irregularities leading\nto inadequate palm oil feedstocks and with controls on imports, the Government is forced to reduce the\nmandatory blending rates from time to time. For example, the reduced CPO supplies and skyrocketing\nprices in early 2015 prompted decision-makers to temporarily lower the mandatory vegetable oil content\nrequirement in biodiesel by 50 percent to B3.5 from B7 in January 2015, and then reinstated B7\nmandates in April 2015. Due to this development, the actual blending rates of biodiesel in diesel total\nuse were 5.8 percent, a level below intentional 7 percent if the B7 mandates were fully accomplished.\nAlthough the government’s policy is to maintain its B7 mandates in 2016 and 2017, in addition to its\nplan to subsidize the use of B20 in large trucks on a voluntary basis, beginning in 2016, the blending\nrates of biodiesel in diesel total use are estimated at around 5.7 percent in 2016 and 6.14 percent in\n2017, given the possible reoccurrences of a step-down in biodiesel mandates at any time following\nweather-vulnerable palm oil supplies. Lately in 2016, the government announced to lower B7 mandates\nto B5, effective on July 25, 2016 because palm oil supplies appeared to be lower than earlier estimates,\nand if the mandates continue, soaring palm oil prices would negatively affect household cooking palm\noil consumers.\nA sharp reduction in global petroleum prices also generated changes in consumer demand for products\nsuch as diesel and gasoline versus the highly subsidized products like liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and\ncompressed natural gas (CNG). Not only did low diesel prices encouraged diesel vehicle users (mainly\n\n\u000ctrucks or trailers) to switch to diesel (which contains biodiesel) from CNG, but it also stimulated\nincreased use of diesel among smaller vehicles (i.e., pick-up trucks). Lower prices for diesel (which\ncontains biodiesel) also led diesel use for other sectors (agriculture, construction, and manufacturing\nindustries) to increase in 2015. Total diesel sales were officially reported as increasing by 4 percent in\n2015 to 21.9 billion liters. Prevailing low prices are expected to drive biodiesel consumption up 4\npercent in 2016 and 2 percent in 2017.\nBased on this diesel market development and the fact that the mandate of biodiesel blending in diesel is\napplied to all types of diesel use, biodiesel consumption rose to 1.230 billion liters in 2015, and should\ncontinue to grow to 1,3 billion liters in 2016 and 1,42 billion liters 2017, respectively.\nBelow is the historical implementation of mandatory use for specific biodiesel since 2007:\n\nJune 2007\nJune 2010\nMarch 2011\nMay 2011\nJuly 2011\nJanuary 2012\nJuly 19, 2012\nNovember 1, 2012\nJanuary 1, 2014\nFebruary 17, 2014\nMay 14, 2014\nJanuary 22, 2015\nApril 17, 2015\nJuly 25, 2016\n\nMandatory use of B2 and voluntary use of B5\nMandatory use of B3 and voluntary use of B5\nMandatory use of B2 and voluntary use of B5\nMandatory use of B3-B5\nMandatory use of B4\nMandatory use of B5\nMandatory use of B3.5\nMandatory use of B5\nMandatory use of B7\nAdjust mandatory use from B7 to B3.5\nReturn implementing mandatory use of B7\nAdjust mandatory use from B7 to B3.5\nReturn implementing mandatory use of B7\nAdjust mandatory use from B7 to B5\n\nBelow is the composition of B7 biodiesel retail prices.\nTable 5.4 Breakdown of B7 Biodiesel Retail Prices, Baht/liter\n\n\u000c5.3 Trade\nThe Thai Government restricts the import of biodiesel to protect domestic palm growers. Thailand’s\nbiodiesel imports and exports are minimal and mostly belong to petroleum oils containing up to 30\npercent biodiesel (HTS Chapter 27). Exports of biodiesel (B100 equivalent) were 3.12 million liters in\n2015, as compared to 3.86 million liters in 2014. Imports of biodiesel products (B100 equivalent)\ntotaled 2.13 million liters, as compared to 11.57 million liters in 2014.\n5.4 Ending Stocks\nBiodiesel production is driven solely by contracts between palm growers and refineries. As a result, the\ncountry’s B100 stocks, held by either biodiesel producers or petroleum oil refineries, are quite low\nsomewhere around 20-50 million liters or about 10-15 days of utilization.\nVI. Advance Biofuels\nThere has been no progress in promoting advance biofuels, and the potential for progress is further\ndimmed due to sharply weaker global prices for petroleum products. A molasses-based ethanol plant\nusing cane bagasse for cellulosic ethanol has stalled due to a lack of commercial feasibility. The\nproduction of Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO), a type of renewable drop-in diesel, is no longer\ncommercialized due to its high production cost without the additional subsidy from the Government.\nVII. Statistical Information\nWhile ethanol is harmonized under 220710 and 220720, Post’s estimate of ethanol imports and exports\nin the Ethanol PS\u0026D (Table 4.1) is based on HS22072011 and HS22072019 reported by the Thai\n\n\u000cCustoms Department. These harmonized codes represent ethanol for fuel and industrial uses.\nMeanwhile, other import and export figures of ethanol under HS220710 and HS220720 will be\nbeverage ethanol which is not include in the PS\u0026D.\nPost’s estimates of biodiesel imports and exports is based on HS271020, described as petroleum oils\ncontaining up to 30 percent biodiesel, and HS382600, described as biodiesel, both reported by Thai\nCustoms Department.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Biofuels Annual_Bangkok_Thailand_7-22-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Kuala Lumpur_Malaysia_7-27-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-21-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual 2016_Prague_Czech Republic_5-10-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-25-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nGVN issues Decree sanctioning violations in plant quarantine_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-25-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Annual 2016_Dakar_Senegal_7-19-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\n","title":"Biofuels Annual_Bangkok_Thailand_7-22-2016.txt","summary":"In 2017, fuel ethanol production and consumption should continue to increase to 1.4 billion liters,\nIn 2017, fuel ethanol production is forecast to increase to 1.4 billion liters, up around 7 percent from\nProduction capacity of molasses-based ethanol is currently around 0.9 billion liters per year.\nIn 2016, fuel ethanol production is expected to increase to around 1.3 billion liters, up 11 percent from\nBiodiesel production is forecast to grow 7 percent to 1.42 billion liters in 2017 in line with an increase\nin diesel consumption and an estimated increase in the blending rates of biodiesel in diesel total use.","keywords":"biodiesel production product products ethanol","latentTopics":"ethanol, liters, b, biodiesel, use, percent, government, palm, oil, mandatory"}

This is a GOI initiative to speed up\nclearances for inbound consignments and to improve India’s ‘ease of doing business.’\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nThe SWIFT system, launched by GOI’s CBEC, enables the exporters and importers to file a common\nelectronic ‘integrated declaration’ on Indian Custom’s Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Gateway\nknown as ICEGATE. The integrated declaration compiles requisite information for Customs, Food\nSafety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Plant Quarantine, Animal Quarantine, Drug\nController, Wildlife Control Bureau, and Textile Committee. The integrated declaration is designed to\nreplace nine separate forms previously required by the abovementioned agencies and Customs. Along\nwith SWIFT, CBEC also introduced an Integrated Risk Management facility for partner government\nagencies (PGAs), which is designed to ensure that consignments are selected based on the principle of\nrisk management and not selected routinely by inspection agencies.\n\nThe GOI has identified the SWIFT system as a key component of upgrading its trade facilitation for\ngoods clearance at the point of entry and exit in India. To coordinate better with agencies and industry\nstakeholders, port and central level Customs Clearance Facilitation Committees established simplified\nand streamlined interagency procedures and documentary requirements for imports and exports. The\nformat of integrated declaration form is pasted at the end of this report and it can also be accessed by the\ncustom house agents (CHAs) through the client portal of Customs.\nAlthough the SWIFT system was implemented as of April 1, 2016, FSSAI did not publish an official\nnotification and only stated the following language on its food import clearance portal:\n‘In the revised scheme of things, the importer/CHA will only be required to upload supporting\ndocuments and any clarifications. Direct filing of Application is disabled now. All fresh filing shall be\naccepted from Single Window only.’\n\n\u000cAn ICEGATE helpdesk is now available on a 24x7 basis and users may contact at their toll free number\n91-011-1800-3010-1000 or email icegatehelpdesk@icegate.gov.in.

Arbulu\nReport Highlights:\nFAS Canada helped to release food shipment from Canadian Customs.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nFAS Canada assisted in the release of export goods for Tillamook Country Smokers (TCS Jerky), a small\nbusiness exporter of beef jerky from Bay City, Oregon by verifying the proper documentation with\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency. Although, the dollar value of this shipment was not large; $4,000, it was\nimportant to this small business exporter of 280 employees to release these goods in a timely manner. The\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency would not release the shipment since the export certificate stickers did\nnot match the establishment numbers on the import documentation paperwork. Mr. Blair Smith, sales\nmanager or TCS Jerky, quickly rectified this problem by issuing correct export certificate stickers and\nshipping them directly to the importer. In addition, per CFIA’S instructions, Mr. Smith was required to get a\nrepresentative of FAS Canada to witness and review all paperwork was correct. FAS Canada responded\nquickly and met with the CFIA inspector to witness all documentation, the shipment was released from\nCanadian Customs in less than five business days.\nTCS Jerky has been doing business in Canada for over 20 years and Canada remains their number one\nexport market. Mr. Smith reports, the firm has not been deterred with the strong U.S. dollar which has\npriced a number of U.S. food products higher than domestic and competing products in the recent year. He\nreports, TSC Jerky’s competitive advantage is offering a quality product, customer service, timely deliveries\nand developing creative merchandising strategies with their Canadian partners to help maintain market\nshare. TCS Jerky remains committed to the Canadian market and plans to invest in building their brand by\nparticipating in more marketing activities in Canada, through the support of USDA’s MAP Branded Program\nadministered by the Western United States Agricultural Trade Association (WUSATA).\nFAS Canada urges all U.S. exporters to ensure all meat establishment numbers, addresses, and descriptions\nare consistent with documentation adhered to the shipping cartons as this will avoid further delays or\nconfusion. New exporters, new to the Canadian market are alerted that all products containing 2% or more\nmeat content require a meat certificate. This certificate is issued by an official of the Food Safety and\nInspection Service (FSIS) of the USDA and is attached with all other import documents.

Market Overview\nIn contrast to its small size and population, the Netherlands is a powerhouse when it comes to the\nproduction and trade in horticultural products. The Netherlands is the largest exporter of live trees and\nplants and the third largest exporter of vegetable products. Within the European Union, they are the fifth\nlargest producer of vegetables and the tenth largest producer of fruit. The Netherlands also plays a key\nrole in horticultural logistics. Over seventy percent of imported fruit and eighty percent of imported\nflowers and vegetables are re-exported. Many third country suppliers find it more efficient and less\ncostly to ship their products through the Port of Rotterdam, especially those destined for Belgium and\nGermany.\nNetherlands Exports of Horticultural Products, 2005-2015, Billion USD\n\nSource:\nGlobal Trade Atlas®\nNote: For the purposes of this report horticultural products are defined by the Harmonized System (HS) Chapters 06 Live trees and plants, Chapter 07\nVegetable products, and Chapter 08 Edible fruits and nuts.\n\nIn 2015, the Netherlands exported $22 billion worth of horticultural products, an 11 percent decline\nfrom the previous year, but still a significant 13 percent of world market share. U.S. exports of\nhorticultural products were valued at $17 million, a 10 percent world market share. Exports from the top\nthree global suppliers declined in 2015, while competition from China and Mexico has been steadily\ngrowing.\nThe European Union is the largest trading partner for Dutch horticultural products; 85 percent of all\nDutch horticultural exports ($18.9 billion) are to the other EU member states with Germany the largest\ncustomer by far, accounting for 38 percent of all Dutch exports to the EU. Horticultural trade with\ncountries that have a European Free Trade Agreement which include Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway\nand Switzerland represent 4 percent of trade ($1 billion) for the Netherlands. After Europe, the United\nStates is the next largest market for Dutch horticultural products with a 1.7 percent share ($370 million),\nRussia with a 1.4 percent ($319 million), and China with .6 percent share ($125 million).\nThe United States imports $370 million of horticultural products from the Netherlands, a value which\nhas been fairly stable over the past few years. The Netherlands is our 9th largest market valued at $517\n\n3\n\n\u000cmillion, three percent of U.S. total horticultural exports. Major U.S. horticultural exports to the\nNetherlands include tree nuts, foliage and sweet potatoes.\nU.S. Horticultural Trade with the Netherlands, 2010-2015, Million USD\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas®\n\nGreenports\n\nGreenport is the term used in the Netherlands for a major horticultural geographic area in which\nhorticultural products are grown and traded. The concept of greenports was introduced in the Ministry of\nEnvironment’s 2004 National Spatial (or Land Use) Strategy. It is based on the idea of a port or\ntransportation hub and each of the greenports have a connection with a major transportation hub. Within\nthese greenports, there is a strong component of cooperation among industry, government, education and\nresearch institutions, and together they focus on collaboration and innovation.\nDesignated Greenport Areas in the Netherlands\nGreenport Westland-Oostland\n\nThis area is the largest international greenhouse horticulture area in the Netherlands.\n\nGreenport Venlo\n\nThis greenport will concentrate mainly on markets like Germany and Central\nEurope.\n\nGreenport Aalsmeer\n\nFloriculture, breeding, propogation, production, sale and trade are concentrated on\nlimited acreage, but with a logistical advantage of being close to Schipol Airport.\n\nGreenport Duin en Bollenstreek\n\nThis greenport focuses more on the cultivation of flower bulbs and is a tourist\ndestination. It is one of the greenport areas where housing, employment and tourism\nare linked.\n\nGreenport Boskoop\n\nThe greenport is well known for tree and shrub crops.\n\nGreenport Noord-Holland Noord\n(also known as Agriboard)\n\nKnown for its large vegetable, potato and fruit production, as well as bulbs, flowers\nand ornamental plants.\n\n4\n\n\u000c1. Chapter 06 Live Trees, Plants, and Bulbs\nThe Netherlands is the number one exporter of floriculture: cut flowers, bulbs (mostly tulips), and live\nplants (mostly mushroom spawn) with about a 50 percent share of the global market. In 2015, the\nNetherlands exported over $9 billion of these products, 86 percent of which went to other European\nmember states, mostly Germany, UK, and France.\nThe floriculture trade is becoming more competitive as countries closer to the equator with more\nfavorable growing conditions are steadily gaining market share. At the same time, the market is no\nlonger growing as in the past. According to Rabobank, this is due partly to economic circumstances, in\nparticular in the case of cut flowers which have a high correlation with disposable income.\nGlobal Trade of HS Chapter 06 Live Trees and Plants), 2000-2015, Billion USD\n\nSource:\nGlobal Trade Atlas®\n\nBulbs\n\nThe area planted to flower bulbs has increased by 75 percent over the past 35 years. Most flower bulbs\nare still grown in the province of North Holland, but cultivation is spreading across the entire country.\nThe most commonly cultivated flower bulb is the tulip. According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS),\ntulips are grown on almost half of all flower bulb fields. In 2015, about 62,000 acres were planted to\nflower bulbs, a new record. In addition to tulips, lilies, daffodils, hyacinths, and gladioli are grown.\nNetherlands Exports of Bulbs (HS 0601) to the World\n\nWorld\nGermany\nUnited States\nChina\n\n2015\nMillion USD\n$1,045.8\n$133.1\n$121.8\n$81.6\n\n2015\nMarket Share\n12.73\n11.65\n7.80\n\nChange 2015/2014\n-16.19\n-36.14\n-13.39\n13.87\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas®\n\nThe Netherlands exported over $1 billion of bulbs in 2015, a decrease of 16 percent although the Dutch\ntrade 76 percent of the world’s bulbs. The tulip has been the most exported flower for many years, but\nthe Netherlands also exports narcissi, hyacinth and gladioli bulbs. The major markets are Germany\n5\n\n\u000c($133 million) and the United States ($122 million). Indicative of the importance of the U.S. market, the\nU.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has a bulb preclearance facility in the\nNetherlands completely supported by Dutch industry.\nLive Plants\n\nThe Netherlands exported $2.5 billion of live plants including indoor ($744 million), outdoor ($636\nmillion), and trees, shrubs and bushes ($290 million) in 2015, a decrease of 23 percent from the previous\nyear.

Thirty percent of the cut flowers were roses. The Netherlands imported $677 million of fresh cut\nroses, about 63 percent of which were from Kenya and Ethiopia. A considerable amount of these roses\nare sold through the Aalsmeer flower auction and then re-exported to other EU countries. In recent\nyears, however, the Netherlands has faced increased competition from growers in Africa and elsewhere,\nmainly due to energy and labor costs. Many of the flowers grown in Africa are produced with direct\nDutch investment.\nNetherlands Exports of Cut Flowers (HS 0603) to the World\n\nWorld\nGermany\nUK\nFrace\n\n2015\nMillion USD\n$3,163.7\n$857.1\n$507.9\n$408.1\n\n2015\nMarket Share\n27.09\n16.06\n12.90\n\nChange 2015/2014\n-18.68\n-19.28\n-31.91\n-14.53\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas®\n\nSome flower traders believe that organic flowers are lower in quality as they don’t look as nice nor do\nthey last as long. As a result, organic flowers have not caught on in Europe yet.\nFlower Auction System\n\nThe history of Dutch flower auctions goes back hundreds of years to now where they are the hub of the\nglobal flower trade and worldwide leaders in setting the price of plants and flowers. The auctions move\nover 60 percent of the world’s trade in cut flowers and 40 percent of the trade in houseplants. Buyers\narrive in the morning and with the push of a button they bid on dizzying array of plants and flowers. It\nused to be that all flowers sold at the auction were physically present, but this is not necessarily the case\nanymore. For the most part, buyers are looking at photos with information about the size, length and\nhealth of their flowers.\n\n6\n\n\u000cThe Dutch Flower Auctions Association (Vereniging van Bloemenveilingen in Nederland, VBN)\nrepresents the Dutch auction houses; however, as a result of mergers, VBN currently has only two\nmembers, Royal FloraHolland and Plantion. With 36 auction clocks and four sites, Royal FloraHolland\nis the largest flower auction in the world. They have an annual turnover of around $5 billion and 4,500\nmembers of which approximately 700 are based abroad. Every day around $55 million worth of flowers\nand plants are sold through this cooperative. Plantion, established in 2008, is also a cooperative owned\nby 275 Dutch growers of flowers and plants.\nFoliage\n\nThe Netherlands is a trade hub for foliage within Europe where all species of foliage are traded. In 2015,\nthe Netherlands exported $239 million of foliage for ornamental purposes, a decrease of three percent,\nmainly to Germany, France and the UK. The most important non-EU market is Russia.\nNetherlands Exports of Foliage (HS 0604) to the World\n\nWorld\nGermany\nUK\nFrance\n\n2015\nMillion USD\n$238.7\n$57.9\n$33.1\n$23.2\n\n2015\nMarket Share\n24.27\n13.86\n9.70\n\nChange 2015/2014\n-2.07\n-0.93\n1.37\n-11.77\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas®\n\nNetherlands Foliage Imports from the World (HS 0604), 2010-2015, Million USD\n\nSource:\nGlobal Trade Atlas®\n\nThe Netherlands is the largest importer of cut foliage in Europe and imported $229 million in 2015, a\ndecrease of 11 percent. The decrease in foliage trade is due to the decline in demand for cut flower\nbouquets. The United States supplied 27 percent of Dutch foliage imports in 2015, valued at $62\nmillion. There are several specialized Dutch importers of foliage. A small amount of foliage is traded at\nthe flower auction; however, mostly it is traded directly. U.S. suppliers can contact FAS/The Hague for\na list of Dutch wholesale traders. The five main products traded are Asparagus, Skimmia, Panicum,\nQuercus and Corylus.\n\n7\n\n\u000cThe market for organic foliage is very small and sellers to Europe must comply with EU legislation.\nOrganic foliage must be produced and processed by natural methods. However, this may be an\nopportunity for U.S. suppliers in the future.\n\n2. Chapter 07 Edible Vegetables \u0026 Certain Roots and Tubers\nThe Netherlands has a 14 percent market share in the world’s vegetable trade, exporting $7 billion in\n2015, mostly to other EU markets such as Germany, the UK, and Belgium. In 2014, China surpassed the\nNetherlands as the largest exporter of vegetables. China, the Netherlands, Spain and Mexico account for\nover half of the world’s vegetable production.\nEighty percent of what is produced in the Netherlands is exported of which approximately half ends up\nin the German market. However, German imports have been declining as the demand for local products\ngrows. German retailers first look to see what is available from local sources. In the past, the Dutch\nsuffered from a reputation of being a commodity producer producing products with little taste. They are\ncompeting with countries like Italy that have a reputation for quality and taste. Dutch producers conduct\na great deal of research and development, and have made great strides in innovation regarding taste.\nThe most important vegetable crops grown and exported by the Dutch are onions, tomatoes, potatoes,\nand cucumbers. The United States is the 10th largest market by value for Dutch vegetables, mostly\ntomatoes and peppers.\nPer capita consumption of vegetables has been declining, but the industry has been able to add value and\nare producing more ready-to-eat vegetables and packaging. The majority of vegetables grown in the\nNetherlands that are consumed domestically are consumed fresh. Although the value of turnover of fresh\nvegetables is growing by about five to ten percent per year, the actual volume amount is decreasing.\nThis has to do with the increased trend in snacking: big tomatoes are being replaced with cherry or grape\ntomatoes, heads of lettuce are being replaced with cut lettuce in bags.\nRussian Embargo\n\nIn August 2014, the Russian Federation banned certain agricultural products from countries that put in\nplace sanctions against Russia in the context of the situation in Ukraine. In July 2015, this ban was\nextended for another year (until August 2016). This covered almost all fruit and vegetable products.\nIn 2013, the Netherlands exported $115 million of vegetables to Russia. This has declined to $42 million\nin 2015 and is likely to decline further this year as Russia tightens up loose ends. The effects of the\nRussian embargo are difficult to assess. The Netherlands has been able to move from one market to the\nnext to fill gaps, such in Brazil and to open new markets such as in the Middle East, Africa and China,\nalthough it is getting harder to open new markets due food safety concerns in importing countries. For\ngreenhouse products like tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, the impact of the Russian ban was minimal\nbecause prices remained stable due to drought in 2015 in other countries.\nPotatoes\n\nThe Netherlands is the largest exporter of fresh potatoes in the world, exporting $600 million in 2015, a\ndecrease of 23 percent from the previous year mostly due to a fall in German demand.\n\n8\n\n\u000cNetherlands Exports of Potatoes (HS 0701) to the World\n\nWorld\nBelgium\nGermany\nAlgeria\n\n2015, Tons\n1,522,803\n210,256\n155,628\n130,918\n\n2015\nMarket Share\n13.81\n10.22\n8.60\n\nChange 2015/2014\n-13.32%\n-17.88%\n-28.68\n-11.73\n\n2015, Million USD\n$600.0\n$54.4\n$51.0\n$67.8\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas®\n\nIn 2014, the Netherlands grew 7 million tons of potatoes, 15 percent of all arable land was dedicated to\npotato production. Approximately 50 percent of domestic production is fresh or ware potatoes, 25\npercent goes to the starch industry, and 25 percent for seed production.\nSeed potatoes account for over two thirds of the total export value. The Netherlands is the largest\nproducer of seed potatoes in the world and they supply sixty percent of the world market. The\nNetherlands exports about 800,000 tons of per year and this has been relatively stable for quite some\ntime, although in 2015, exports reached a record 815,000 tons. The Dutch export to about 80 countries\nworldwide. Their largest market is Algeria as their climate is not suitable for growing seed potatoes, and\nthe second largest market is Belgium to supply their French fry processing sector.\nThe Netherlands has two varieties potatoes that are protected through the EU geographical indications,\nthe Opperdoezer Ronde and De Meerlander.

Dutch tomato production takes place mostly in greenhouses and 85\npercent are sold by grower associations. The Dutch grew 860 thousand tons of tomatoes in 2015 and is\nestimated to yield 900 million kg in 2016. In 2015, almost 90 percent of the crop was exported. The\nmost important buyers were Germany and the UK. Exports of tomatoes have declined in recent years\ndue to food safety issues.\nOnions\n\nIn 2015, the Netherlands had a nine percent share in the world export market for onions. About 6 percent\nof arable Dutch agricultural land is used for the cultivation of Holland onions. Over the past 15 years\nthis has increased by 50 percent resulting in over 74,000 acres. Some Asian countries, such as India and\n9\n\n\u000cPakistan have a preference for Dutch onions as their water content is lower and they fry better than other\nvarieties.

In 2015, the Netherlands\nexported $932 million, a decrease of 8 percent. In 2015, the Dutch signed an agreement, one of the first\ncountries to do so, to ship sweet peppers to China. The first trial shipment was sent in July 2016. These\npeppers also mark the first efforts to create a Dutch brand. The market is expected to permanently open\nin 2017 if all goes well with the trial shipment.\nThe United States is the third largest market for Dutch sweet peppers. In 2015, the Netherlands exported\n$56 million of sweet potatoes to the United States.\nAsparagus\n\nThe Netherlands is the fifth largest importer of fresh asparagus, almost all of which is re-exported. In\n2015, the Netherlands imported $66.9 million, mainly from Peru (83 percent), but a small amount also\ncame from the United States (four percent). The Netherlands is the third largest exporter of fresh\nasparagus and in 2015, exported $77.6 million, a 14.91 percent decrease from the previous year.\nWhite asparagus grown in a southern Dutch region known as Brabantse Wal has been given official\nEuropean Commission recognition as a protected regional product. The listing means only asparagus\ngrown in the area using traditional methods can carry the label Brabantse Wal. The area around Bergen\nop Zoom was the center of Dutch asparagus growing until the 1950s. The amount of land used to\ncultivate asparagus in the Netherlands has gone up 60 percent since 2000.\nOrganic Production\n\nDutch production of organic greenhouse vegetables increases 15-20 percent annually. This is reflected in\ndomestic consumption. The total consumption of organic products in the Netherlands passed the one\nbillion euro threshold in 2013 and fresh organic vegetable consumption represents 68 percent. The\nNetherlands is a major producer of organic vegetables and a market leader in organically grown spinach,\npeas, beans, carrots and onions.\nDutch exports of organic products are estimated at $1 billion annually. Carrots and tomatoes are among\nthe top five organic products exported. Neighboring countries remain the most important market for\nDutch exports of organic products, but exports to the United States have seen strong growth.\nTo make organic farms more competitive with regular agriculture, the government has signed a\ncovenant with supermarkets, the Dutch Confederation of Agriculture and Horticulture (LTO) and other\n10\n\n\u000cparties for the joint promotion of organic products and a wider selection in the shops. It is anticipated\nthat these efforts will lead to at least a 10 percent increase in organic product sales.\nSweet Potatoes\n\nThe Netherlands is a major transportation hub for sweet potatoes, in particular U.S. sweet potatoes. In\n2015, the Netherlands imported $58.9 million, a 13 percent increase from the previous year, more than\nhalf of which was re-exported ($39.3 million) making the Netherlands, the second largest exporter of\nsweet potatoes after the United States.\nNetherlands Imports of Sweet Potatoes (HS 071420), 2010-2015, Tons\n\nSource:\nGlobal Trade Atlas®\n\nSweet potatoes accounts for over half of total U.S. vegetable exports to the Netherlands. In 2015, the\nNetherlands imported 38,815 tons of sweet potatoes from the United States valued at $39.5 million, an\nincrease of 51 percent by volume from the previous year. The United States is the largest supplier of\nsweet potatoes to the Netherlands, supplying 67 percent of their total imports in 2015. Ninety nine\npercent of imported sweet potatoes are fresh and only one percent are frozen.\nThere is a growing interest by sweet potato suppliers to enter the Dutch market and not just from the\nUnited States. Dutch traders receive one or two calls a week particularly from Chinese suppliers\ninterested in breaking into the market. The Dutch traders place a lot of value on building strong\nrelationships with their suppliers and loyalty is important to them. In addition, there is a growing\nconcern among many Dutch traders that there are too many importers of sweet potatoes; causing\nincreased competition and lower prices.\nProduct is usually brought in through the port of Rotterdam or Antwerp. Traders import the product\ndirectly from a U.S. supplier and then put the pallets on trucks to sell to local retail outlets or other EU\nmember states. Most of the importers are selling pallet size shipments. The trucks going to other MS do\nnot have to be full. This is the beauty of shipping to the Netherlands first, logistical center.\n\n3. Chapter 08 Edible Fruits \u0026 Nuts; Citrus Fruit or Melon\nThe Netherlands imported $6.6 billion and exported $5.9 billion worth of fruits and nuts in 2015.\n11\n\n\u000cNuts\n\nThe United States is a large supplier of tree nuts to the Netherlands. In 2015, the Netherlands imported\n$582 million of nuts of which 55 percent were from the United States. The United States supplied 51\npercent of all the almonds, 27 percent of all pistachios and 12 percent of all walnuts imported by the\nNetherlands.\nNetherlands Global Trade of Nuts, 2015, Tons\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas®\n\nFor more information , see the EU Tree Nuts Report.\nCitrus\n\nThe Netherlands are one of the largest importers of citrus within the EU. In 2015, the Netherlands\nimported $972 million of citrus fruit mainly oranges from South Africa ($285 million) and mandarins\nfrom Spain ($154 million). For more information, see the EU Citrus Report.\nApples and Pears\n\nThe Netherlands imported $236 million apples mainly from Chile and New Zealand, and $149 million\npears from South Africa and Chile. Also a major exporter, the Dutch exported $188 million apples and\n$335 million pears. The domestic production of apples declined by 7 percent in 2015 to 320,000 tons.\nTraditional Dutch apple varieties are Elstar and Jonagold; however, new varieties come into the market\nevery year. The latest new varieties are Kanzi and Junami.\nThe domestic production of pears has increased substantially over the last 25 years, although it was\ndown slightly last year from a record high to 317,190 tons. The variety grown in the Netherlands is\ncalled Conference. Most of the apples and pears entering the Netherlands are re-exported to other EU\nmember states. For more information, see EU Fresh Deciduous Fruit Report.\nThe Russian ban had a dramatic impact on pear growers. An EU intervention program purchased pears\nto help make up for the loss, but not enough for prices to rebound. As a result, Dutch pear growers have\nsuffered in the past two years from the ban. The Dutch pear export industry has spent a lot of resources\nto promote domestic consumption and open new new markets in China and the United States. In 2014,\nafter five years of bilateral consultations and negotiations, the Dutch Conference pear finally received\n12\n\n\u000cmarket access to the Chinese market. There were more than 1 million kg of Dutch Conference pears\nexported to China during the first season. Currently, the United States is reviewing applications from\neight EU member states to export apples and pears including the Netherlands.\n\nSection II.

While most states are\nseeing adequate or above-average rainfall, a few states have deficits and many state reservoir levels\nremain below the 10-year average. The Indian Meteorological Department forecasts monsoon rainfall\nfor the second half of the season to be above the long period average.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nAbove Normal Monsoon Rains Expected for the Second Half of the Season\nAs a whole, India received normal rainfall from June 1 through July 31 with zero percent departure from\nthe long-period average (LPA) for the southwest monsoon. On August 1, the Indian Meteorological\nDepartment (IMD) forecast rainfall to be 107 percent above the LPA for the second half (August and\nSeptember) of the monsoon season. According to the IMD, southwest monsoon rainfall was 11 percent\nbelow the LPA in June but 7 percent above the LPA for July.\nTable 1.

Eastern and northeast India are 15 percent\ndeficient as of August 4, 2016. Even in states where excess rainfall occurred, some districts remain\ndeficient, too. According to IMD data, there are 8 meteorological subdivisions covering 18 percent of\nthe area of the country that have received deficit rains.\nQuickened Kharif Planting Pace as Soil Moisture Good\nAccording to spatial analysis, surface and subsurface soil moisture remains higher than last year for\nIndia. The planting pace of Kharif crops is 6 percent faster than last year. Planting of pulses has seen a\n41 percent increase this season whereas cotton planting has seen a 9 percent decline (see Table 2).\nReservoir Levels for All India Remain Below 10-Year Average\nA number of regions still see below 10-year average reservoir levels across the 91 major reservoirs of\nIndia (see Table 3). States having better storage than last year include Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh,\nAndhra Pradesh and Telangana. States having lower levels than last year are Himachal Pradesh, Punjab,\nRajasthan, West Bengal, Tripura, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand,\nChhattisgarh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

Even though most Slovak consumers still remain price-sensitive, there is\na growing number of consumers willing to pay a higher price for a higher quality. U.S. exports of\nconsumer-oriented agricultural products to Slovakia grew more than three times in the past five years,\nfrom $1.3 million in 2010 to $5.1 million in 2015. U.S. food exports with good sales potential include\nmainly frozen fish fillets and dried fruits and tree nuts.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nSECTION I. MARKET SUMMARY\nAs a result of the improved economic situation in Slovakia in 2015, increased consumer purchasing\npower and declining unemployment rate, sales in the grocery retail market also increased. In 2014 retail\nsales grew by 3% reaching U.S.$ 8 billion in 2015. A positive development and outlook for the\neconomic situation in Slovakia is having a large positive impact on the retail sector.\nSlovak consumers are becoming increasingly aware of two important factors when it comes to\npurchasing groceries: composition of the product (contents of artificial ingredients and colorants) and\norigin of the product (local, EU, overseas). These two factors, which influence consumer behavior, are\ndriven by healthy lifestyles and fair trade patriotism. Both of these factors are fashionable among the\nSlovak population, especially in cities and among very affluent consumers.\nThe Slovak government and non-government organizations (NGOs) support these consumer trends with\nofficial educational programs and official marks and labels for Slovak or regional products. This led to\nmodern grocery retailers being obliged to publicly present the shares of goods by country origin in their\noutlets. Some important players used these trends and built their marketing communications around the\npositive approach to Slovak and local products and healthy lifestyles. However, there still exists the\nsegment of consumers that prefers the best value for money and shop mostly during price discounts and\nvarious price promotions.\nHypermarkets with 5% growth rate in sales in 2015 represent the most popular channel with a 29%\nmarket share, closely followed by supermarkets. Consumers prefer larger-scale purchases from largerformat stores, leaving smaller and more frequent shopping to smaller-format outlets such as\nconvenience stores, supermarkets or grocery specialists.\nDiscounters, the second most popular outlets, such as German-owned chain Lidl, witnessed the fastest\ngrowth rate in sales in 2015, around 8%. Lidl is popular due to its fresh fruit and vegetable assortment,\nhigh-quality products and most importantly, consumer-friendly prices. All of this is supported by strong,\npermanent marketing campaigns focusing every week on a different grocery or non-grocery assortment\nthat attract more and more consumers to Lidl’s stores.\nConvenience stores represent the third largest channel with a 21% value share of modern grocery\nretailers in 2015. Consumers tend to now make smaller value purchases from smaller format stores, as it\nbecame more popular to make large weekly or even monthly shipping trips to hypermarkets. This trend\nis significant, especially in cities, where there is high penetration of grocery retailers.\nInternet retailing is becoming increasingly popular, with food and drink internet retailing growing by\n14% in current value terms in 2015, but among the modern grocery retailers, only Tesco Slovakia\nprovides this service, via Tesco Grocery Home and Tesco Click and Collect. Other retailers continued to\nlaunch online stores of grocery products. On the other hand, there are a number of small, local online\nstores operating in the Bratislava area.\n\n\u000cRetailers in Slovakia\nOutlets\nValue sales in U.S.$ million\nSelling Space 1'000 sq m\nSource: Euromonitor\n\n2012\n12,471.00\n7,207.19\n1,919.50\n\n2013\n12,237.00\n7,362.80\n1,969.90\n\nRetailers in Slovakia: Company % Value Share\n% Retail Value\nCompany\nTesco\nTesco\nLidl\nSchwarz Beteiligungs\nKaufland\nSchwarz Beteiligungs\nCoop Jednota Potraviny\nCoop Jednota Slovensko\nCOOP Jednota Supermarket\nCoop Jednota Slovensko\nBilla\nRewe Group\nTerno\nDiligentia\nFresh\nPotraviny FRESH\nCBA\nCBA Kereskedelmi\nCoop Jednota\nCoop Jednota Slovensko\nHypernova\nRoyal Ahold\nBala\nBala\nCarrefour\nCarrefour\nMilk-Agro\nMilk-Agro\nSource: Euromonitor\n\nAdvantages\nImproved economic situation, increased\nconsumption is expected\nHigh quality of U.S. products and growing trend\ntoward eating what is healthier and tastes better; an\nopportunity for U.S. nuts, dried fruits and specialty\nproducts\nGood infrastructure, importers speak good English\nClose distance to Vienna, Austria, that offers many\nU.S. food products\nWillingness to try new products; innovative\nproducts and packaging increase demand\n\n2014\n11,980.00\n7,706.17\n2,033.50\n\n2012\n17.6\n10.0\n8.8\n11.1\n6.3\n7.2\n3.2\n3.6\n1.6\n2.2\n1.1\n1.1\n0.9\n\n2013\n17.0\n10.0\n9.6\n11.0\n7.2\n7.1\n3.4\n3.2\n1.7\n1.8\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n\n2015\n11,758.00\n7,945.69\n2,056.30\n\n2014\n17.0\n10.7\n9.9\n10.1\n7.5\n6.9\n3.9\n3.5\n3.1\n1.6\n1.4\n1.0\n0.9\n0.9\n\n2015\n16.7\n11.2\n10.7\n10.2\n7.5\n6.8\n4.1\n3.5\n3.1\n1.6\n1.2\n1.0\n0.9\n0.9\n\nChallenges\nHigher prices of U.S. products\nHigher competitiveness of some EU products\ndue to elimination of tariffs between the EU\nand the Czech Republic\nNegative perception of GMO, fast food, etc.\nRelatively small volumes with high\ntransportation costs\nShelf life – retailers will not list a product\nwith a “use-by-date” shorter than 2/3 of the\ntotal shelf life and transportation takes some\ntime\n\n\u000cSECTION II. ROAD MAP FOR MARKET ENTRY\nEntry Strategy\nFood retailers have their own purchasing section and buy products either directly (e.g. Billa offers many\nproducts directly imported from neighboring Austria) or from Slovak or Czech importers. METRO\nCash and Carry has several U.S. products supplied by Czech importers (almonds, pecans, cranberries),\nwhile other U.S. products (bourbon and wine) are supplied by Slovak importers. U.S. exporter should\ncontact the FAS Prague office for a list of importers and distributors.\n\nPrivate labels\nPrivate labels are used by all retailers in Slovakia. About 20% of products are private labeled. Coop\nJednota has 9 different private labels.\nSpecialty Stores\nSpecialty stores can be mainly found in new modern shopping malls in larger cities, especially the\ncapital Bratislava. Specialty restaurants in the food court include e.g. Nordsee, offering a wide range of\nfish product. There are specialty healthy product stores “BioPark” in these malls. U.S. exporters can sell\ntheir high value organic products or nuts in these outlets.\n\nExample of BioPark store in AuPark mall in Bratislava and U.S. pecans found there (FAS)\n\nMarket Structure\n\n\u000cU.S. exporters can address Czech importers who supply both Czech and Slovak markets or Slovak\nimporters, it depends on the commodity. Dried fruit and nuts are supplied by Czech importers, alcoholic\nbeverages by Slovak importers. An interested exporter should contact the FAS Marketing Specialist in\nPrague covering both countries for a list of importers and distributors.\n\nCompany Profiles\nRetailer Name\n\nOwnership\n\nTesco\n\nU.K.\n\nMarket share of\nretailers in 2015 in %\n16.7\n\nLidl\n\nGerman\n\n11.2\n\nKaufland\n\nGerman\n\n10.7\n\nLocations\nLarger\ncities\nWhole SR\nLarger\ncities\n\nPurchasing Agent\nType\nDirect Import \u0026\nLocal Distributor\nDirect Import \u0026\nLocal Distributor\nDirect Import \u0026\nLocal Distributor\n\n\u000cCoop Jednota\nCoop Jednota\nSupermarket\nBilla\n\nSlovak\nSlova\n\n10.2\n7.5\n\nWhole SR\nWhole SR\n\nLocal Distributor\nLocal Distributor\n\nGerman\n\n6.8\n\nWhole SR\n\nTerno\nSlovak\nSource: Euromonitor and FAS\n\n4.1\n\nWhole SR\n\nDirect Import \u0026\nLocal Distributor\nLocal Distributor\n\nBilla\nThe company is fully owned by the German company Rewe Group. Billa stores can be found\nnationwide in Slovakia, but particularly in urban areas. Billa’s turnover in 2015 was U.S.$ 520 million.\nThe company focuses purely on retailing and offers a special loyalty program for its customers called\nBilla Card, which offers a points-based bonus system where a purchase of €0.01 equals one point. Billa\nhas national outlet network coverage in Slovakia, operating 130 supermarkets and five convenience\nstores.\nBilla offers its Clever and BIO private labels. Both offer a wide range of products at lower prices than\nbranded goods. The private label line Clever is positioned as a budget range, which provides quality at\nlow prices. The company claims that a minimum of 85% of its suppliers are domestic.\nThe BIO range is a mid-priced organic private label line, which generally offers cheaper bioproducts\nthan original branded ones. These groceries are mainly produced in Austria and the Czech Republic.\nBilla’s value share within supermarkets in 2015 reached 26%. The company was also active within\nconvenience stores where it occupied the 14th position in 2015. Billa continues to be positioned as a\nmarginally more expensive supermarket and therefore concentrates on maintaining strong\ncommunication with customers.\n\nExample of Billa supermarket (Euromonitor)\nCoop Jednota\nCoop Jednota is a cooperative that consists of 32 independent associations. Turnover in 2015 was U.S.\n$1,486 million. It is not only the largest grocery seller by volume in Slovakia, but also the chain with\nthe most outlets. The company’s aim is to be the “rural supermarket”, where customers can make\n\n\u000ccomplex, fast purchases with further assistance, such as UNIKASA (cashback). It focuses on the\nreconstruction of existing outlets and on improving the culture of selling and increasing the\neffectiveness of outlets.\nCoop Jednota is a member of Euro Coop, a European-wide network of cooperatives that has its own\nprivate label. Coop Jednota plans to retain its leadership of convenience stores and supermarkets. It will\nimprove its value share through continual development of its private label products and by acquiring\nstores from its competition or by opening new stores. The company greatly underlines the importance of\nregional sustainability and on its heavy engagement in domestically-sourced products that can be found\non its shelves.\n\nExample of traditional Coop Jednota (Euromonitor)\n\nSECTION III.

Executive Summary\nCoordinator: Roswitha Krautgartner / FAS Vienna\nProduction\nIn MY 2016/17, overall production of EU-28 major oilseeds (rapeseed, sunflower and soybeans) is expected to be\nabout 1 percent higher than in the previous year and will reach some 32.53 MMT. This is mainly an effect of\nhigher average yield expectations for sunflower and somewhat higher for soybeans compared to the previous\ncrop. Sunflower production is forecast to be up by more than 11 percent reaching 8.5 MMT. Major sunflower\nseeds producing EU countries increased their sunflower area, with the highest growth rates in Spain and\nHungary, followed by Romania and Bulgaria. The leading producer France, however, reports a substantial decline\nin planted area due to unfavorable weather conditions. Overall, this results in a 0.5 percent increase in total\nsunflower area. Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria have benefitted from favorable spring weather conditions\npromising an excellent sunflower crop. EU soybean production, which is still at a minor level but constantly\nincreasing, is anticipated to be 2.7 percent up, totaling 2.3 MMT. Soybean area is revised down from previous\nforecasts and is expected to be 2.4 percent lower year-on-year. Bulgaria, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and to\na lesser extent the Czech Republic report smaller acreages. With an expected production of 21.5 MMT, output of\nrapeseed is almost 3 percent lower compared to the previous year. Unfavorable growing conditions are expected\nto result in lower yields, especially in France, Germany, the UK, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The outlook for\nrapeseed production in France is adjusted sharply downwards. Increased rapeseed acreage and favorable\ngrowing conditions in some eastern European countries like Hungary and Romania may not offset the reductions\nin major European producing countries.\nConsumption\nHigher output and availability of sunflower is expected to result in increased sunflower meal use in animal feed\nwhile rapeseed meal use will be reduced due to lower production. Together with an almost flat soybean meal\nuse, total EU-28 consumption of major oilseeds meals in animal feed is forecast to remain almost flat in MY\n2016/17 (plus 0.4 percent year-on-year).\n\nPage 3\n\n\u000cEU-28 Oilseeds Market Update, July 2016\n\n2.

However, the total area planted in soybeans is lower because of declines in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Austria,\nHungary, Italy, and to a lesser extent in the Czech Republic.\n\nPage 6\n\n\u000cEU-28 Oilseeds Market Update, July 2016\n\nA recovery in supply is expected because of higher South American plantings. Compared to MY 2015/16, crush\nis expected to remain stable and total soybean meal imports are expected to increase slightly, with a rise in the\nNetherlands and in Poland and a decline in all the other major importing countries. Feed use of soybean meal is\nexpected to increase slightly as well.\nMY 2015/16\nDue to the damage to the soybean crop in Argentina and Uruguay, the availability of soybeans from South\nAmerica will be limited in the coming months. In the Netherlands, part of the imports of meal from Argentina will\nbe replaced with beans from the U.S. and to a lesser extent from Brazil to be crushed in the Netherlands. In spite\nof this new trend, total soybean imports in MY 2015/16 are expected to remain lower than in MY 2014/15.\nSoybean meal imports and feed use are limited by the tight supply situation. In the Netherlands, which are the\nmain importers of soybean meal in the EU, imports from third countries are expected to decline by ten percent\ncompared to MY 2014/15. Soybean meal is partially substituted by other meals and in some countries, including\nSpain, there is an extensive use of wheat in the feed formula.\nCompared to MY 2014/15, biofuel use of soybean oil increases by around 100,000 MT in Spain and decreases by\naround 110,000 MT in Germany.\n4.

Though\nfarmers have increased acreage by 35,000 hectares, growing conditions have not been as good as in the\nprevious MY. This will result in lower yields especially in France, Germany, the UK, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\nThe outlook for rapeseed production in France was adjusted sharply downwards, since heavy rainfalls in May and\nJune favored the development of insects and fungi. The outlook for German production was also revised down\ndue to a lack of rain in Northeastern Germany. The reductions in major European producing countries could not\nbe offset by favorable growing conditions in some eastern European countries like Hungary and Romania. In\nthose countries, fair weather conditions with abundant rainfall and mild temperatures led to adjustment upwards\nfor rapeseed production with the possibility of record yields in Romania.\nThe smaller rapeseed crop in MY 2016/17 will lead to a smaller supply of domestic production on the European\nmarket. Imports are expected to decrease due to tight global supplies and competition with other importers like\nChina, Mexico and Japan. In particular, there is less export potential in Ukraine since farmers planted less\nrapeseed. European exports are expected to increase a bit due to production gains in Romania which will partly\nbe shipped to Turkey. Rapeseed crush is expected to decrease further, leading to a smaller production of\nrapeseed meal and oil. European ending stocks of rapeseed are expected to shrink significantly.\nAs substitutes for rapeseed, it is estimated that there will be a good supply and competitive prices for sunflowers\nand soybeans in the future. Demand for rapeseed meal is mainly driven by the European dairy sector with most\nmajor producers reducing herds due to long-lasting low milk prices. In total, sunflower meal, soybean meal and\ngrains are expected to replace rapeseed meal in feed ratios to some extent. The shut-down of biodiesel plants in\nFrance, plus more profitable biodiesel production from waste oil, animal fat and lower price imported oils like palm\noil, has reduced European demand for rapeseed oil. Therefore, demand projections for the European biodiesel\nindustry were adjusted down.\nMY 2015/16\nEU rapeseed production for MY 2015/16 was revised slightly upwards to 22.1 MMT in MY 2015/16 due to the\nlatest update of official numbers in France and the UK. This is still nearly 2.5 MMT lower than the record crop in\nthe previous MY. The lower supply of domestic production led to imports from Australia, Ukraine and Canada,\nwhich will nearly reach record levels. High imports could not offset lower production so crushing of rapeseed in\nthe European is expected to decrease to 24.3 MMT. Stocks are expected to be a little lower at the end of the MY.\nConsumption of rapeseed meal decreased mainly due to availability. The use of rapeseed oil for biofuels was\nrevised downwards due to adjustments for France.\n5.

The leading producer France,\nhowever, reported a substantial decline in planted area due to adverse weather. This results in less than one\npercent higher total planted area for the EU-28.\nMain producers (Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria) have benefitted from favorable spring weather with moderate\ntemperatures and sufficient rainfall which promised an excellent crop, although current summer dryness in Central\nand Eastern Europe may moderate these expectations. France reported a mixed picture with negative effects on\nthe crop caused by the rainy and cool weather (fungal diseases, slugs attacks) and any bird attacks. Areas under\nhigh oleic and confectionary sunflower are reported to decline slightly.\nAt present, average EU-28 yields are projected to be 8-10 percent higher than in MY 2015/16 and to lead to 11\npercent annual growth in the sunflower seeds production reaching 8.5 MMT but still below the record crop in MY\n2014/15.\nExpected recovery of the EU-28 production, although uneven between member states, is projected to reduce the\noverall import demand. On the other hand, forecasted record world supply (Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, Argentina)\nis likely to offer more competitive options for EU crushers. Thus, we project about 20 percent reduction in\nimports. Exports to the third countries are estimated to be stable or slightly lower, discouraged by good domestic\ndemand.\nThe most significant change is projected for the crush demand which is expected to increase by 6 percent (0.4\nMMT) to 7.4 MMT. Crush margins are forecast to be lower on average compared to the previous marketing years\nbut to improve gradually throughout the upcoming season, stimulated by improved demand both for sunflower\nmeal and oil. All EU-28 member states expect flat or growing crush volumes (exception is Italy) with the most\nsignificant upward changes for France, Spain and Romania, followed by Hungary and Bulgaria.\nThe EU-28 domestic demand for sunflower oil is expected to be very favorable, conservatively estimated at 3\npercent higher consumption, and at the highest level for the last three seasons. The demand for sunflower meal\n\nPage 11\n\n\u000cEU-28 Oilseeds Market Update, July 2016\n\nis also likely to improve due to expected better competitiveness of the sunflower meal compared to competing\nrapeseed and soybean meals, and projected abundant Black Sea supply.\nHigher total sunflower seeds supply may provide room for rebuilding stocks although the rebounding consumption\nmay limit accumulation of stocks which are expected to remain below the levels in MY 2014/15.\nMY 2015/16\nLittle adjustments were made in area and production based on the latest statistical data.\nImports were revised upward due to new shipments from Argentina, Moldova and Russia in the spring of 2016,\nthus imports to date (October 2015- April 2016/World Trade Atlas) totaled 265,000 MT. Imports are forecast to\ngrow slowly later in the season in order to compensate for lower domestic supply. On the other hand, further\ngrowth in imports may be prevented due to expected lower crush in the EU-28 compared to MY2014/15 as a\nresult of falling crush margins and competition from soybeans. Some countries have revised downward their\nearlier estimates for crush (Spain, Romania, Italy, Germany) while Portugal and Hungary see small increases. In\nselect countries, exports became a more profitable option than crush. Ending stocks and stocks to use ratio are\nlikely to remain low.\nSunflower Meal\nMY 2016/17\nEU-28 sunflower meal output is forecast to increase by 6 percent in line with higher crush. Despite better\ndomestic availability, imports are projected to grow compared to the current year in order to meet the rising\ndemand which is estimated to rebound due to price attractiveness of sunflower meal. Good and competitive\nregional supply is also likely to stimulate imports. France, Spain, Germany, Hungary and Romania expect higher\nuse of sunflower meal compared to M Y2015/16 while other member states expect use to be flat. Sunflower meal\nexports are forecast to increase slightly due to better supply in the EU-28.\nMY 2015/16\nImports of sunflower meal during October 2015 through April 2016 (Global Trade Atlas) were at 2.0 MMT or only\n5 percent lower compared to the corresponding period in MY 2014/15, with the main suppliers Ukraine and\nRussia. Argentina, the third major supplier, shipped much higher volumes of sunflower meal to the EU-28 in 2016\n(January - April), more than double compared to the previous season. We currently estimate annual imports to be\nstable compared to the previous year, although sunflower price attractiveness in the second half of the season\n(especially versus soybean meal) along with still good supply from major exporters may result in more purchases.\nWe estimate a reduced meal use at about 4.0 percent due to lower total supply. Sunflower meal exports during\nOctober 2015 through April 2016 decreased by more than 30 percent compared to the corresponding period in\nMY 2014/15. Thus annual exports are likely to be much lower than in the previous season.\nSunflower Oil\nMY 2016/17\nThe output of sunflower oil is expected to grow by 6 percent due to higher crush. Higher oil production is\nestimated in France, Romania, Spain, Hungary, Germany and Portugal. Local demand for food use is projected\nto be supportive as a result of shortage of rapeseed oil and may stimulate more imports despite better domestic\nsupply. In addition, Black Sea region expects record high and price competitive supplies which will make imports\nattractive. Spain, Germany, Hungary, United Kingdom, Romania and Portugal expect higher food use of\nsunflower oil compared to MY 2015/16. Exports of oil are forecast to increase by 12 percent due to better supply\nin the EU-28.\nMY 2015/16\n\nPage 12\n\n\u000cEU-28 Oilseeds Market Update, July 2016\n\nSunflower oil output is forecast to decline by 10 percent versus MY 2014/15 due to lower crush.\nSpain, Romania, Italy, and Germany have revised previous oil output estimates downward.\nFood consumption showed uneven trends. Some countries (France and Portugal) revised their consumption\nupward, although this was more than offset by declines in other countries (Spain, Hungary, Italy, Germany and\nUnited Kingdom) where food use was revised down. This brings total food use for the EU-28 to 1.7 percent more\nthan in MY2015/16. Expectations for imports are for a 30 percent growth compared to MY 2014/15 to\ncompensate for lower production. Leading importers are France and Spain. Imports to date are sourced from\nUkraine. In 2016 (January – April / GTA), Ukraine’s deliveries to the EU-28 have doubled and accounted for 94\npercent of all imports. Currently, MY 2015/16 imports are estimated at 1.1 MMT with 730,000 MT imported\nbetween October 2015 and April 2016. Exports are expected to decline due to lower domestic supply.\n\nPage 13\n\n\u000cEU-28 Oilseeds Market Update, July 2016\n\nRelated Reports\nRelated EU-28 and Country Reports:\nOilseeds Market Update|Oilseeds and Products|Sofia|Bulgaria|7/5/2016\nBulgarian farmers increased rapeseed planted area by 5% and soybean area was reported to decline by 42%.

The view of the\nsupporters is that the new provisions will force retailers to source more food products from Romanian\nproducers and encourage expansion of local production, while opponents argue that the new law will\ntrigger higher prices for food products and is not a guarantee of increased competitiveness. Although the\nlaw is in many respects vague and incomplete and requires additional legislation, AgBucharest\nattempted to assess the initial potential impact on U.S. food exports.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nOn July 15, 2016 a new law amending existing legislation on food trading was published in the Official\nGazette. It brings instructions on how the relationship between retailers and food suppliers should work\nin regard to payment terms, goods reception, shelves, labelling and origin of food sold in modern retail.\nThe initial draft included only restrictions on the work schedule of the large retail shops (over 2,500\nsqm) prohibiting them to open stores on Sundays and during local holidays. The Romanian Government\nreviewed and rejected the proposal in September 2015. In their view, if approved, the law would lead to\nfood consumption decline since in general Romanian consumers tend to shop during weekends. In\naddition the Romanian Government found the law as being discriminative by imposing the rules only on\nlarge retailers. The Romanian Senate, as the first chamber to debate the bill, rejected the proposal back\nin November 2015.\nThe decisional chamber for this draft is the Lower House of the Romanian Parliament, so the text\nmoved to Chamber of Deputies. In the review process, the text was analyzed by several entities, such as\nCommittee for Industry, Legislative Council, Romanian Government, each issuing an opinion. While\nsome of these bodies agreed with the draft, Romanian Government reconfirmed the lack of support for\nthe law again in March 2016.\nThe Committee for Agriculture of Chamber of Deputies strongly supported the proposal. During the\nconsultation process, the paragraphs on work schedules were removed, but a great deal of new\namendments was incorporated. The Ministry of Agriculture publicly supported the proposal despite the\nfact that the Romanian Government rejected it. On June 8 2016 the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies\noverwhelmingly voted in favor of the bill. On July 12 2016 the President of Romania promulgated the\nlaw and three days later, on July 15 2016, Law 150/2016 amending and supplementing the Law\n321/2009 on food products trading was published in the Official Gazette.\nSome of the changes introduced by the law have been subject to strong live debates among the major\nplayers in the food sector, agricultural producers, processors, and retailers. The Association of Large\nRetailers Network (AMRCR) has been very vocal over the past year and actively participated in the\ndebates organized at the legislative level. In their view the proposal is aimed at \"undermining modern\ncommerce\", warning that \"short supply chain does not guarantee support for Romanian producers and\nnarrows Romanian consumers the freedom to choose.\" The Association defined the amendments as\nbeing \"anticompetitive and discriminatory\" and warned that the concept of “short supply chain” adopted\nwas not at all a guarantee that Romanian consumers will have access to local products to a larger extent\nor that Romanian local producers would be protected from the competition of external producers.\nFurthermore, the association requested the Romanian Government and Chamber of Deputies to notify\nthe European Union regarding the full text of the revised law. Smaller retailers were in favor of the law\nthough as their scale of operations in terms number of stores and product range offers them more\nflexibility in the relationship with the suppliers.\nLocal agricultural producers’ and processors organizations hailed the law considering it a step forward\nin developing local agricultural production. In their view the new law will create the legal framework\nfor a fair profit distribution along the whole agri-food chain, while the share of Romanian food products\n\n\u000con the retail shelves will grow.\nContent of the law\nThe final form of the law introduces definitions for terms such as of “Romanian meat”, “Romanian\nproduct”, “acquisition price”, “sale-at-loss” etc. The law provides a definition also on “short supply\nchain”. According to the law, “Romanian product” is a product obtained on the national territory from\nraw materials originating 100 percent from farms located in Romania. Another term is “short supply\nchain”. “Short supply chain” is the chain which involves a limited number of economic operators\nengaged in activities of the cooperation and local economic development, as well as geographical and\nsocial relationship among producers, processors and consumers.\nFollowing complaints from local suppliers, one of the amendments addresses the high fees charged by\nthe retailers, so the new law forbids retailers to invoice/re-invoice and claim payments for fees and\nservices from suppliers. Moreover, retailers are prohibited from imposing on suppliers the obligation not\nto sell to other retailers the same products at the same or lower price they purchased. The new law also\ntackles the payment terms, introducing a maximum of 7 calendar days in case of fresh products and 30\ncalendar days term in which the retailer must pay the supplier.\nThe law also altered the legislation on meat labelling for products sold in Romanian territory. The new\nlabel should contain the following information: origin country of the animal, country where the animal\nwas born in, raised, slaughtered, the health stamp/identification and name of the commercial operator,\ncountry of the cutting plant. In the case of meat products, the label must indicate the percentage of meat\noriginating from Romania.\nNevertheless, the article generating the strongest debate is the one making it mandatory for retailers to\nsource through the “short supply chain” at least 51 percent (of the volume of merchandise displayed on\nthe shelves) for each of the following food categories: meat, eggs, fruits, vegetables, honey, dairy\nproducts and bakery goods. The above-mentioned provision does not apply to retailers with an annual\nturnover or total assets of less than two million EURO (equivalent in local currency). In order to bring\nmore clarification regarding the “51 percent rule” the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture will issue an\norder setting up the framework in which the amounts may be supplemented with products from outside\nthe short supply chain, as a result of consultation with entities part of the common market organization.\nThe paragraph referring to 51 percent will enter into force in 6 months after publication, which means\nJanuary 15, 2017. However it is not clear when the Implementing rules are expected to be drafted.\nThe new law also brings an obligation for retailers to allocate distinct space for the display and sale of\nRomanian products, within the terms of the law. In addition, retailers must conduct promotional and\nselling activities for Romanian food products, the frequency and scheduling being determined through a\ndecision of local authorities.\nIn terms of law enforcement, the law failed to provide a reasonable implementation time (three days)\nand did not include specific deadlines for the subsequent legislation to be issued. The law set\nimplementation dates only for meat labelling and the rule of 51 percent, implying that the majority of\nprovisions are enforced immediately. Therefore, in order to comply with law, retailers proceeded to\nnotifying their suppliers about the need to renegotiate existing contracts, especially regarding delivery\n\n\u000cof goods and payments terms. Failure to comply with the provisions of this law triggers high penalties\nfor retailers, including revoking their functioning permits.\nAs the law is expected to have major effects on supply chain for goods originating from other EU\nmember states and third countries, notifying the provisions of the new law to the EU Commission and to\nthe World Trade Organization is necessary as well. The current text only states that the Veterinary and\nFood-Safety Authority must notify the EU member states about the new provisions on meat and meat\nproducts labelling and provide justification for adopting such provisions. The specific provisions on\nmeat will enter into force in 90 days after the moment of EU communication.\nWho should be concerned?\nThe law is anticipated to impact retailers, suppliers and consumers. Following the laws adoption,\nretailers warned about the need to redesign their commercial policies, renegotiate contracts with their\nsuppliers, and reconsider the programs targeting local product promotion, including Romanian products.\nOn the other hand, while the bill is expected to encourage expansion of local production in the long-run,\nsuppliers have a huge challenge in short-run in fulfilling retailers’ needs in terms of quantity, quality,\nassortment, and logistics. This is a valid concern in case of products such as fresh fruits and vegetables.\nConsidering the large number of suppliers that retailers work with, retailers warned that all of their\nsupplies must be fully equipped in order to be capable of issuing/approving payment documents in such\na short time. Consequently some of the retailers may proceed with analyzing their portfolio and exclude\nfrom their shelves goods which have a slower turnover rate, certainly disadvantaging some suppliers\nand consumers.\nOn the other hand, consumers might face an increase in prices at the retail level as competitive suppliers\nmight be eliminated in favor of the ones complying with in the criteria imposed by the new law.\nMoreover, shifts in retailers’ portfolios due to the new conditions may lead to a deterioration in the\nrange of products consumers have access to.\nIs there an impact on U.S. food and beverages exports?\nUnited States is among the top 15 agricultural trading partners of Romania. In 2015 total U.S. agrifood\nexports to Romania increased by 45 percent from U.S. $ 96 million to U.S. $139 million. According to\nthe trade data available for January - April 2016 U.S. total food and beverages exports grew by 18\npercent compared to last year, reaching U.S. $48.5 million.\nThe major part of U.S. exports on the Romanian market consists of raw commodities, products used in\nthe food service sector or in local food-industry as ingredients. Therefore, based on the export structure\nand the current information available in the market, AgBucharest estimates that these amendments will\nnot have a major impact on the United States food exports. Nevertheless, AgBucharest will continue to\nmonitor the legislation and the developments in this area and will report accordingly.\nEnd of report.\n\n\u000c\u000c","similarList":"New Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nRetail Food Sector Report_Prague_Slovakia_8-2-2016.txt\nRussian Agricultural Policy and Situation Bi-Weekly Update - 10_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-20-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nRetail Market Update_Sofia_Bulgaria_7-14-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nStone Fruit Report 2016_Berlin_Germany_7-21-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nGVN issues Decree sanctioning violations in plant quarantine_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-25-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nRenewed Temporary Export Ban on Some Hides and Skins_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-22-2016.txt\n","title":"New Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt","summary":"New Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in\nA new bill threatens to impact food retail operations and the supply chain in Romania.\nsupporters is that the new provisions will force retailers to source more food products from Romanian\nproducers and encourage expansion of local production, while opponents argue that the new law will\nOn July 15, 2016 a new law amending existing legislation on food trading was published in the Official\nin regard to payment terms, goods reception, shelves, labelling and origin of food sold in modern retail.\nThe law also altered the legislation on meat labelling for products sold in Romanian territory.","keywords":"retail retailers retailer food foods romanian","latentTopics":"law, retailers, romanian, local, suppliers, supply, meat, new, terms, chain"}

With the strong recovery in the monsoon since last week\nof June, the cumulative rainfall for the week ending July 20, 2016 was one percent above normal, with\nabout 30 of the 36 weather subdivisions receiving normal and above normal rains. Region wise, the\ncumulative rainfall in Central India was 13 percent above normal, Northwest India was 6 percent above\nnormal, Southern Peninsula was 3 percent above normal, but only the relatively high rainfall region of\nEast and Northeast India was 17 percent below normal. See IMD website\nhttp://www.imd.gov.in/pages/monsoon_main.php.\nThe Indian Metrological Department continues to forecast near normal or above normal rainfall over\nmost of the country through first week of August. On June 2, 2016, the India Meteorological\nDepartment (IMD) in its long range forecast update on 2016 monsoon said the overall precipitation\nlikely to be 104 percent of LPA during August. For more information on monsoon reporting, please\nrefer GAIN reports IN6060 and IN6087.\nKharif Planting Progress Steady\nAfter a relatively delayed and weak early monsoon, timely and sufficient 2016 monsoon rains since\nearly July supported strong recovery in planting of kharif crops during the ongoing season. Water levels\nin the reservoirs have improved significantly in July, providing more water for irrigation.\n\n\u000cSource: Ministry of Agriculture, GOI.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) estimates total area sown till July 22, 2016 at 69.3 million hectares\ncompared to 67.1 million hectares same time last year, with most of the increase accounted by higher\nacreage under pulses, coarse cereals and rice.\nTable 1: India: Planting of Kharif Crops in Indian Crop Year (July/June)\n(Area in Million Hectares)\nICY 2015/16 Progressive Planting till\nICY 2016/17 Progressive Planting till\nCrop\nJuly 22, 2015\nJuly 22, 2016\nRice\n18.24\n18.31\nPulses\n6.47\n9.08\nCoarse\n12.63\n13.08\ncereals\nOilseeds\n14.30\n14.92\nSugarcane\n4.74\n4.54\nCotton\n9.95\n8.69\nTotal\n67.10\n69.30\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India (GOI).\n\nWith the forecast of sufficient 2016 monsoon rains through August, planting of most kharif crop is\nlikely to conclude on time by mid-August. However, planting of rice in northern (mostly long grain\nBasmati) will continue through August and in some parts of south India through early September.\nPlanting of pulses and coarse grains, typically sown in unirrigated areas, has been significantly ahead of\nlast year on optimal soil moisture conditions, and is likely to be over by end-July. Planting of pulses has\nbeen significantly higher supported by high market prices and government’s minimum support prices\n(see IN6091). Sufficient rains since July and consequent favorable planting conditions in the major\ngrain producing states is likely to support Post’s MY 2016/17 kharif grain area and production forecast.\nSufficient and well distributed rains throughout August and September will be critical for achieving\nforecast normal yields. However, heavy rains and prolonged floods in traditionally flood prone eastern\nIndia may adversely affect the crop prospects.\n\n\u000cRICE\nTable 1.

A clear picture for India’s MY 2016/17 rice production prospects will emerge by end\nof August after planting is over in most states.\nAssuming normal rainfall during August/September and normal weather conditions through harvest\n(October/November), Post continues to forecast MY 2016/17 production at 105 MMT from 44 million\nhectares. However, excess rains and prolonged floods in August/September and major cyclonic build\nup and heavy rains in September/October could lower the forecast.\nPrices Firm\n\n\u000cDomestic prices have firmed up in July on steady export demand in the recent months. Satisfactory\nplanting of MY 2016/17 rice crop and sufficient government rice stocks are likely to keep prices steady\nin the next couple of months.\n\nSource: Agricultural Marketing Information Network, Ministry of Agriculture, GOI\n\nGovernment Procurement Strong, Offtake Weak\nGovernment rice procurement during the ongoing season has been supported by sufficient domestic\nproduction and relatively weak export demand in the early part of the marketing year (October 2015 –\nFebruary 2016). Total MY 2015/16 rice procurement through July 26, 2016, is estimated at 34.1MMT\ncompared to 31.6 MMT during the same period last year, with the increase largely accounted by the\nnorthern states (Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh). With some additional procurement in eastern and\nsouthern states through September, total MY 2015/16 rice procurement is estimated at 34.6 MMT, about\n8 percent higher than last year and marginally lower than the record procurement of 35 MMT in MY\n2011/12.\nMarket sources report that the MY 2015/16 government rice offtake under the public distribution\nsystem (PDS) has been relatively weak as government made a concentrated effort to off load the MY\n2015/16 (April/March) rain damaged wheat. Based on the latest available official figures, average\nmonthly offtake of rice during the first nine months of MY 2015/16 was estimated at 2.6 MMT/month\ncompared 3.0 MMT/month for the same period in MY 2014/15. Market sources expect rice offtake in\nthe last quarter to improve as government off load more rice through various programs instead of wheat\ndue to current tight government wheat stocks.\nEnding Stocks Raised\n\n\u000cPost’s MY 2015/16 ending stocks estimate is raised to 18.5 MMT (16.2 MMT government rice and 2.3\nMMT private) on higher government rice stocks due to higher procurement and relatively weak offtake.\nMY 2016/17 ending stocks are also forecast higher at 16.4 on forecast normal procurement and\ngovernment offtake assuming forecast production.\nGovernment-held rice stocks as of July 1, 2016, are officially estimated at 24.7 MMT, about 3 MMT\nhigher than last year level. Government rice stocks on October 1, 2016, are projected at 16.2 MMT on\nexpected normal procurement and relatively stronger monthly offtake (3.0 MMT/month) due to tight\ngovernment wheat stocks in the last quarter (July-September). Relatively weak export demand right\nfrom the beginning of the marketing year discouraged private trade to purchase rice to cover future\ndemand. Consequently, MY 2015/16 ending stocks with private trade is estimated lower at 2.3 MMT\ncompared to 3.6 MMT last year.\nConsumption Lowered\nMY 2015/16 consumption has been revised lower to 93.6 MMT to account for the revised ending\nstocks.\nExports Steady\nIndian rice exports have steadied since the beginning of CY 2016 on recovery in export demand for\nBasmati rice and non-Basmati rice from African countries.\n\nSource: Monthly exports through May 2016 from Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence (DGCIS),\nGOI.\n\nAccording to the provisional official statistics, rice exports for the first five months of CY 2016 4.4\nMMT, down about 15 percent compared to the same period last year. There has been a recovery in\nexport demand for Basmati rice (largely due to competitive prices) and revival of demand for non-\n\n\u000cBasmati rice in African countries. However, exports prospects to neighboring Bangladesh, the leading\nmarket for non-Basmati, is unlikely to improve as Bangladesh government has further raised the import\nduty on rice. Assuming no significant changes in the export demand and price parity for Indian rice visa-vis other origin, CY 2016 (MY 2015/16 exports) will reach the estimated 9.2 MMT at the current pace\nof exports. Post continues to forecast CY 2017 (MY 2016/17) rice exports unchanged at 8.5 MMT.\nWHEAT\nNote: No changes in the official PSD to report. No significant market development to report from the\nlast update (IN6091).\nCORN\nNote: No changes in the official PSD to report.\nMY 2016/17 Planting\nSufficient and well distributed 2016 monsoon rains have boosted MY 2016/17 corn planting, with total\ncorn area through July 22, 2016, estimated at 6.8 million hectares compared to 6.2 million hectares last\nyear. Higher planting is being reported in the major producing states like Karnataka, Maharashtra,\nMadhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Planting is likely to be over by 2nd week\nof August on forecast normal rains in August, unlike last year wherein planting was affected in the\nseveral rain deficit states. Assuming normal monsoon through August/September, Post continues to\nforecast MY 2016/17 corn production at 23 MMT. However, excess rains during September/October\nmay affect the yield prospects as the crop would be at the harvest stage. However, sufficient rains\nduring September/October will be critical for planting prospects for the rabi season (planted on\nOctober-November) and winter corn (planted in January).\nPrices Gain…\nWith the arrival of MY 2015/16 rabi corn tapering off, domestic corn prices during June and July\nfirmed up significantly on relatively strong domestic demand.\n\n\u000cSource: Agricultural Marketing Information Network, Ministry of Agriculture, GOI\nMarket prices in the major producing states currently range from INR 13,500 ($201) to INR 18,000\n($268) per metric ton (spot). Prices are expected to remain firm in August/September on tight supplies,\nbut favorable MY 2016/17 planting and production prospects and expected weak international prices are\nlikely to contain significant price movements in the future.\n…Govt allows Extension on Imports under TRQ...\nWith the growing concerns on the rising corn prices raised by the local corn users (poultry and starch\nindustries), government is exploring the option of importing relatively cheaper corn from the\ninternational market under the tariff rate quota (TRQ) of 500,000 metric tons at zero duty in the Indian\nfiscal year 2016/17 (April/March). On July 11, 2016, the government gave an extension to the\ngovernment parastatals responsible for canalizing imports under the TRQ to apply for the IFY 2016/17\nTRQ from March 31, 2016, to August 8, 2016. The three government parastatals issued notification to\nactual buyers seeking their interest in importing non-genetically modified corn under the TRQ (PEC,\nSTC and MMTC) based on which they will be applying for the IFY 2016/17 TRQ.\n… Non-GM Condition Constrain Import Prospects\nMeanwhile on July 14 and July 15, 2016, the PEC issued two tenders for importing 120,000 MT of nonGM corn under specific conditions in different ports, which was cancelled due to lack of response from\nthe exporters (only one bid quoted at $252/MT). STC and MMTC have also issued tenders, but market\nsources report that these tenders may not get adequate response due to lack of supplies of corn that can\nbe certified non-GM from the exporting country. Consequently, Post continues to estimate MY 2015/16\ncorn imports unchanged at 250,000 MT.\nSince the TRQ is applicable through March 2017, the PEC has issued a tender for 200,000 MT of nonGM corn for imports during mid-December through end-January, the period after the kharif corn and\nbefore the rabi corn marketing season. Market sources report that the tender may receive more interest\n\n\u000cas the future prices quotes for the period are very competitive. Post continues to forecast MY 2016/17\ncorn imports at 200,000 MT due to the spillover of the IFY 2016/17 TRQ imports.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Grain and Feed Update_New Delhi_India_7-28-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Dhaka_Bangladesh_8-5-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nCotton and Products Update - July 2016_New Delhi_India_8-3-2016.txt\nMonsoon Update - Second Half Forecast Calls for More Rain_New Delhi_India_8-5-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-18-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-28-2016.txt\nCrop update - France weighs heavy on otherwise positive prospects_London_United Kingdom EU-27_7-20-2016.txt\nRice Price - Weekly_Bangkok_Thailand_7-19-2016.txt\nNile Nuggets for July 2016_Cairo_Egypt_7-24-2016.txt\nRice Price - Weekly_Bangkok_Thailand_7-20-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-21-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_7-15-2016.txt\nPork - 2016_New Delhi_India_7-21-2016.txt\nMinistry of Agriculture Paves the Way for US Corn Imports_Brasilia_Brazil_8-4-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nStone Fruit Report 2016_Berlin_Germany_7-21-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\n","title":"Grain and Feed Update_New Delhi_India_7-28-2016.txt","summary":"raised to 18.5 MMT on estimated higher government rice stocks.\nWith the forecast of sufficient 2016 monsoon rains through August, planting of most kharif crop is\nIndia: Planting of Kharif Rice by State for week ending July 22\nplanting of MY 2016/17 rice crop and sufficient government rice stocks are likely to keep prices steady\nsouthern states through September, total MY 2015/16 rice procurement is estimated at 34.6 MMT, about\nMarket sources report that the MY 2015/16 government rice offtake under the public distribution\nMMT private) on higher government rice stocks due to higher procurement and relatively weak offtake.","keywords":"rice corn planting planted","latentTopics":"rice, planting, year, july, last, normal, government, corn, india, august"}

This report reviews the\nperformance of the SaborUSA campaign during the first seven months in 2016.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nSaborUSA is a non-traditional marketing campaign in Colombia, funded by FAS’s Global Broad-Based\nInitiative (GBI). There are 19 cooperators participating in the GBI, with the lead cooperator being the\nCalifornia Pear Advisory Board. Cooperators in the project represent a wide range of agricultural\nproducts including pears, meat, peanuts, wine, liquors, apples, poultry and eggs, popcorn, grains, table\ngrapes, dry beans, soybeans, rice, pulses, sunflowers, other consumer oriented products, and most\nrecently, Alaskan seafood.\nThe overall objective of the SaborUSA campaign is to increase U.S. consumer-oriented exports to\nColombia by building a growing community of Colombian consumers who are interested in U.S. food\nculture. The campaign takes advantage of the U.S.-Colombian Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA), a\ngrowing economy, and Colombia’s fascination with all things American. The Colombian Canal 13 TV\nstation is the implementing partner for SaborUSA. Launched in 1998, Canal 13 is a regional television\nchannel that focuses on younger audiences. We are also partnering with the Public Affairs Section of\nthe U.S. Embassy. Although SaborUSA is initially focused on Colombia, we would like to eventually\nexpand the campaign to other Spanish speaking countries.\nThe Campaign Has Four Key Components\nThe campaign has four key components that supercharge cooperator activities by increasing the reach of\nthe audience for these activities and promoting the SaborUSA brand to Colombian consumers.\n\n1. Television Cooking Show\nThe flagship of our campaign is the TV cooking show. In 2015 SaborUSA partnered with Canal 13’s\nPlan Chef cooking show, which had been on the air since 2011. Plan Chef helped to familiarize the\nColombian audience with the SaborUSA campaign and cooperator products.\nIn 2016 we created our own cooking show, I\nSaborUSA. Canal 13 will no longer air Plan Chef.\nThe new host is Karina Palmer, an engaging bilingual restaurateur and food blogger. Plan Chef’s\ncreative team will also be the creative team for the new show. The show features celebrity chefs who\nprepare dishes using U.S. cooperator products. Each episode has a different theme that appeals to\nColombians such as holidays, exercise, healthy eating, and U.S. regional cuisine. The show airs on\nCanal 13 at 7 pm (Colombian time) on Saturday evening. We also live-stream the show on the\nSaborUSA.co website and place previous episodes on our website.\n\nPlan Chef\n\n\nWe filmed 25 episodes of Plan Chef in 2015. The total audience for the show (both live and\nrepeat episodes) was 323,000 viewers. The first show, the 4th of July episode, was extremely\npopular and featured Ambassador Kevin Whitaker as the first “guest chef” (below left is a\npicture of Ambassador Whitaker with the show’s host Alejandro Canedo). On November 14,\nthe “California Dreaming” episode with FAS Administrator Karsting (pictured on the right with\n\n\u000cChef Canedo) aired on Canal 13.\n\n\n\nI\n\nFor the success of the show, Plan Chef was recently nominated for a TAL Award (Latin\nAmerica’s public television show awards) for interactive content for a television show. This\nnomination is a recognition of the success of our non-traditional marketing campaign that links\nour TV food show with our interactive website, smartphone application and social media.\n\nSaborUSA\n\n\n\n\n\nOur new show, I\nSaborUSA, will have a guest chef for each episode, where we challenge our\nguests to prepare a meal using cooperator products.\nWe showcase a market to table approach, sharing the experience from purchasing ingredients to\npreparing a meal.\nI\nSaborUSA began airing in mid-June on Canal 13 at 7 pm (Colombian time) on Saturday\nevening.\nWe will be taking I\nSaborUSA on the road, filming several episodes of the show in the\nUnited States and in different cities in Colombia. In fact, we recently filmed two episodes in\nCartagena during the Sabores Cartagena gastronomic festival, featuring the celebrity American\nchefs Gia Passalaqua and Rock Harper (below left is a picture of host Karina Palmer with Chef\nGia and on the right is our host with Chef Rock Harper).\n\n\u000c\n\nIn late June, we filmed an episode with USDA Deputy Under Secretary (DUS) Jonathan\nCordone (DUS Cordone is pictured with host Karina Palmer below). The theme of the show was\nthe popularity of barbecuing in the United States and featured U.S. porterhouse and T-bone\nsteaks. The show should be part of the upcoming U.S. Meat Export Federation’s promotional\ncampaign in Colombia.\n\nThe cooking show and promotional campaign successfully links market development with trade policy\nsuccess. After several years of hard work on the part of the U.S. government, Colombia reopened its\nmarket for U.S. bone-in-beef cuts in January 2016 after it had been closed for several years because of\nBSE fears.\n\n\nThe SaborUSA team continues to partner with the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy to\nexpand the campaign’s audience. The U.S. Embassy’s website and social media are extremely\npopular in Colombia. We are also increasing our engagement with the State Department’s\nCulinary Diplomacy Program to showcase U.S. celebrity chefs on the show.\n\n2. Interactive Web Site (SaborUSA.co)\nThe homepage of the website has a brief explanation on SaborUSA and we live stream I\nSaborUSA\nepisodes on the site on Saturday evenings. The website also has a navigation menu with six tabs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Us: A video on SaborUSA and information on participating cooperators\nEnjoy: Information on products represented by cooperators\nGet Inspired: Recipes by category such as children, special celebrations, etc.\nFind Out About Us: Blog, news feed, Plan Chef episodes\nParticipate: Upcoming events and product promotions\nShare: Contact us, recipes sent by the SaborUSA community\n\nThe website went public on July 11, 2015. At the end of July 2015, the website had 839 unique hits.\nAs of June 2016, the web site has had 19,944 unique hits, an increase of 2,277% since the campaign\n\n\u000cstarted.\n\n3. SaborUSA Smartphone Application\nThe SaborUSA smartphone app features recipes with cooperator products and is utilized by consumers\nto discover cooperator products. It is easy and free to download for both androids and I-phones.\nWe started the app on July 7, 2015. At the end of July we had 66 downloads. At the end of June 2016,\nwe had 575 downloads, an increase of 771 % in twelve months.\n\n4. Social Media\nWe are using Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, and Instagram to promote SaborUSA and\ncooperator activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SaborUSA Facebook site went public in early July. As of June 2016, Facebook had 7,489\nfollowers, an increase of 4,384% since the campaign started.\nAs June 2016, Twitter had 389 followers, an increase of 1,668% since the campaign started.\nAs June 2016, Instagram had 758 followers, an increase of 1,084% since the campaign started.\nWe also have a SaborUSA YouTube channel.\n\n\u000cMarketing Activities\nWe are using SaborUSA to supercharge cooperator activities and promote the SaborUSA brand to\nColombian consumers. In 2015 we promoted 21 marketing activities for U.S. food products, which\nreached thousands of Colombian consumers.\nDuring the first seven months of 2016 we have promoted twelve marketing activities for U.S. food\nproducts. These activities included: Washington apple promotions; a Californina wine tasting event; a\nCochran gastronomy education and promotion program to the United States for 15 Colombian chefs; the\nlaunching of the I\nSaborUSA TV show for Colombian media; a SaborUSA booth at Alimentec trade\nshow, the largest food show in Colombia; U.S. cooperator product participation at the Embassy’s 4th of\nJuly celebration at the Ambassador’s Residence; and the SaborUSA booth at the Sabores Cartagena\ngastronomic festival. We also filmed I\nSaborUSA episodes that complemented already planned\nU.S. rice and poultry promotional activities.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"SaborUSA Increases the Popularity of U.S. Food in Colombia_Bogota_Colombia_7-29-2016.txt\nFAS Sofia Promotes U.S. Agricultural Products at a Big Culinary Fest_Sofia_Bulgaria_7-14-2016.txt\nFAS Sofia Promotes U.S. Agricultural Products at the Biggest Culinar_Sofia_Bulgaria_7-15-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\nFAS Canada Assists Small U.S. Exporter_Toronto_Canada_7-19-2016.txt\nStrong Results at Vinexpo Hong Kong 2016 for U.S. Wines_Hong Kong_Hong Kong_7-20-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nParliament to Study Duty Deferral Program -Milk and Poultry Trade_Ottawa_Canada_8-9-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nBrazil Agricultural Economic Factsheet_Brasilia_Brazil_7-25-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nRetail Market Update_Sofia_Bulgaria_7-14-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Ottawa_Canada_8-4-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\n","title":"SaborUSA Increases the Popularity of U.S. Food in Colombia_Bogota_Colombia_7-29-2016.txt","summary":"SaborUSA is a non-traditional marketing campaign in Colombia that promotes U.S. food and beverages\nThis nomination is a recognition of the success of the SaborUSA campaign that links our food\nSaborUSA is a non-traditional marketing campaign in Colombia, funded by FAS’s Global Broad-Based\nthe audience for these activities and promoting the SaborUSA brand to Colombian consumers.\nColombian audience with the SaborUSA campaign and cooperator products.\nSaborUSA began airing in mid-June on Canal 13 at 7 pm (Colombian time) on Saturday\nThe cooking show and promotional campaign successfully links market development with trade policy\nThe SaborUSA smartphone app features recipes with cooperator products and is utilized by consumers","keywords":"saborusa market marketing","latentTopics":"saborusa, u, show, chef, colombia, campaign, colombian, plan, activities, july"}

The\nroadshow took place in seven of the biggest cities in the country. FAS/Sofia, with the strong support of\nlocal importers, successfully promoted big variety of U.S. agricultural products available on the\nBulgarian market and used the opportunity to educate industry representatives and end consumers about\nthe high quality and diversity of U.S. food and beverages. According to statistics provided by the\norganizers, the campaign was broadly covered by more than 120 specialized, mainstream, and online\nmedia. More than 100,000 people visited the event (over 95% of them visited the U.S. stall). The\ncampaign reached more than 4.07 million Facebook users and the web site of the campaign was visited\nmore than 2.6 million times during the event from March 1st to May 30th. (Remark: The population of\nBulgaria is 7.2 million). So far there has not been another opportunity for FAS/Sofia to reach such a\nlarge audience of current and potential consumers.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nThe main purpose of the activity was to promote culinary traditions of various countries to show their\ndiversity and stimulate trade, culinary, and cultural partnership.\nThe purpose of FAS/Sofia’s participation was to increase the importers, distributors, packers, retail, and\nHRI sector awareness of the high quality U.S. agricultural products currently available on the Bulgarian\nmarket, and to signify the bilateral trade and investment opportunities existing in the food and\nagricultural sector.\n1. Market Constraints and Opportunities:\nOpportunities\nIncrease of consumption of food and beverages is creating demand for more imports.\nMigration of people from rural to urban areas continues at a rapid pace.\nBulgarian value good quality food, innovative, healthy and reasonably priced products.\nGrowing food processing industry is looking for new imported food ingredients.\nEfficient domestic distribution network.\nBulgarian market is accessible by sea.\nMarketing costs to increase consumer awareness are considerably low.\nConstraints\nBulgarian membership in the European Union puts U.S. exporters in a less favorable position than\nEU member states because of duties.\nReduced consumer budget due to price-conscious consumers.\nBulgarian domestic producers are receiving European funding to upgrade production efficiency and\nproduct quality.\nBulgarian farmers increase agricultural production, reducing demand for imports in the country.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate and current appreciation of the U.S. dollar against Euro puts U.S.\nexporters at a disadvantage compared with exporters of the EU. Bulgarian Lev (BGN) has a fixed\nexchange rate against the Euro (EURO 1 = BGN 1.95583)\n2. Expected Results and Desired Outcomes:\n\nDue to the anticipated high visitors’ attendance rate, FAS/Sofia expected that the awareness about U.S.\nagricultural products and culinary traditions will be strongly increased among end consumers as well as\namong current and potential importers, who were invited by FAS/Sofia, and others who attended\nindividually. The media and social media releases were expected to enhance broadly the informational\ncampaign. Leading importers were asked to provide products to be displayed and sampled such as U.S.\nwhiskey, wine, tree nuts, dry fruits, popcorn, snack foods, beer, and pulses.\nAlthough end consumers are usually not an attainable target at FAS/Sofia’s promotions, the event\npromised to provide an excellent opportunity to reach this audience as well as current and potential\nimporters, culinary experts and bloggers, and media representatives. The event helped to further\nstrengthen FAS/Sofia’s relations with the importers.\n1. Actual results and Outcomes:\n\n\u000cOn May 12-28 FAS/Sofia participated in the first of a kind for Bulgaria culinary festival “Bulgaria\nMeets the Flavors of the World”. The event was organized by the Bulgarian Ministry of Tourism, GTC\nBulgaria, HRC Culinary Academy, and International Women’s Club in Bulgaria in partnership with 18\nEmbassies, 7 Municipalities, 7 leading shopping centers, leading companies such as Coca-Cola,\nBulgaria Air, Wizz Air, Zagorka, Bilateral Chambers of Commerce, and over 150 private companies\nand importers. The campaign was officially launched on March 1st with a press conference lead by the\nDeputy Minister of Tourism and attended by Ambassadors, trade partners, and national media.\nThe roadshow was held in the shopping malls of seven of Bulgaria’s biggest cities as follows: opened\non May 12 in Stara Zagora and continued on May 14 in Burgas, May 16 in Plovdiv, May 18 in Veliko\nTarnovo, May 20 in Ruse, May 22 in Varna, and the closing event was held in Sofia on May 28.\nFAS/Sofia’s Marketing Specialist Alex Todorov represented FAS at the U.S. stall in five cities and\ndirectly interacted with industry, trade, HRI, and retail representatives as well as culinary professionals\nand media. He coordinated with importers, interested to have their U.S. products displayed and\npromoted, as well as provided information and promotional materials to the visitors. Mr. Todorov was\nthe main contact for the organizers regarding logistics and performance, met with current and potential\nimporters in each city, established relations with media representatives, bloggers, Culinary Academy\nofficials, and government representatives.\n\nThe USA stall\nThe organizers built a Gourmet Alley in the food court zone in the main shopping malls where each\ncountry had a designated booth/stall with a recognizable image. FAS/Sofia, with the support of the\nimporters, promoted various U.S. agricultural products available in Bulgaria such as whiskey, wine,\nnuts, dry fruits, popcorn, beer, beans, and lentils. The FAS Marketing Specialist provided the visitors\nwith information about U.S. agriculture and products, as well as giving away lots of handout\npromotional materials such as brochures, leaflets, etc. At the end of the alley there was a cooking\ninstallation where professional chefs conducted culinary shows three times a day and presented meals\ntypical for each country. All participants were given the liberty to decorate their stall per their personal\nvision of how to achieve best promotional effect.\n\n\u000cPromotional Banners in the Shopping Malls\nThe Mayors of each town supported the event and most of them participated in the openings. Many\nAmbassadors and other members of the diplomatic community attended as well. The closing event in\nSofia was opened by the Minister of Tourism and many diplomats. This helped to provide additional\npublicity to the event.\n\nThe Mayor of Plovdiv Ivan Totev at the opening (left) and in conversation with an Ambassador,\nFAS/Sofia booth immediately behind (right)\nExceptional outreach:\nAccording to statistics provided by the organizers, the event’s outreach exceeded everyone’s\nexpectations as it was broadly covered by more than 120 specialized, mainstream, and online media.\nMore than 100,000 people visited the event (over 95% of them visited the U.S. booth). The campaign\nreached more than 4.07 million Facebook users and the web site of the campaign was visited more than\n2.6 million times during the campaign from March 1st to May 30th. (Remark: total population of\nBulgaria is 7.2 million people). So far there has not been another opportunity for FAS/Sofia to attain\nsuch a large audience of end consumers, industry professionals, media, and government representatives,\nand to perform such a large-scale promotion of U.S. agricultural products and culinary traditions.\n\n\u000cOfficial opening in Stara Zagora and Ruse\nFAS/Sofia was supported by Coca-Cola HBC Bulgaria who also participated in the event. Coca-Cola’s\nrepresentatives were located right next to the USA booth. This was a strong attention-drawing factor for\nthe visitors as free Coca-Cola samples were given away, which together with the perfect location of the\nUSA booth, directed visitors’ flow straight to the booth. After getting a free Coca-Cola sample all\nvisitors stopped by the USA booth and talked with the FAS Marketing Specialist about the displayed\nproducts as well as received promotional brochures about the products and information on where they\ncan buy them.\n\nThe U.S. stall in Varna\nEach country’s culinary traditions were presented by a respected Chef from the HRC Culinary\nAcademy. USA’s culinary was represented by distinguished Chef Henri Donneaux, who is a Head\nInstructor at HRC Culinary Academy with over 24 years of professional experience in Belgium, France,\nand the U.S., and who has worked with world renowned 3 Michelin star Chefs.\n\n\u000cChef Henri Donneaux preparing an American meal\nThe U.S. Embassy announced the event and posted pictures from the main locations on the Embassy’s\nFacebook page. The Facebook posts received hundreds of likes and shares.\n\nEmbassy Facebook page posts\nThe event also included a noble charity element. Almost U.S. $10,000 were collected by the organizers\nand donated to hospitals, children in need, and their families.\nFAS/Sofia received a Certificate of Appreciation on behalf of the U.S. Ambassador in Bulgaria.

For the 2015/16 MY, post estimates that South Africa will have to import about 3.5\nmillion tons of corn, as drought reduced normal corn production by more than 40 percent. In the\n2014/15 MY, South Africa imported almost 2.0 million tons of corn to augment local production.\n\nPost:\nPretoria\n\n\u000cExecutive Summary\nThe area to be planted with corn later in 2016, for the 2016/17 MY, will be influence in a positive\nmanner by relatively high local corn price levels, due to the past dry season. Hence, post forecasts that\naround 2.8 million hectares of corn will be planted later in 2016, under normal climatic conditions,\nwhich is about 10 percent higher than the five year average in area planted. Under normal climatic\nconditions and taking into account the subsistence farming sector, South Africa’s corn crop for the\n2016/17 MY could reach 12.6 million tons. As a result, South Africa should return to be a net exporter\nof corn in the 2016/17 MY of about 1.0 million tons of corn.\nPost increased its previous corn crop (including commercial and subsistence farming) estimate for the\n2015/16 MY by 600,000 tons to 7.6 million tons on 2.2 million hectares after the Crop Estimates\nCommittee released its sixth estimate for the South African corn crop. South Africa will have to import\napproximately 3.5 million tons of corn in the 2015/16 MY to meet local demand. So far, South Africa\nhas imported 370,000 tons of corn mainly from Argentina (yellow corn) and Mexico (white corn).\n\nUS$1 = Rand 14.36 (7/26/16)\n\n[1]\n\nThe marketing years (MY) used in the text refer to the USDA marketing years in the PS\u0026D table, and\ndo not necessarily correspond with the marketing years used by the South African grain industry.\nCORN\n\n\u000cProduction\nThe area to be planted with corn later in 2016, for the 2016/17 MY, will be influenced in a positive\nmanner by relatively high local corn price levels, due to the past dry season. Local corn prices are\nexpected to trade at import parity price levels for at least until next years’ harvest season, giving\nfarmers enough initiative to plant more fields of corn. Hence, post forecasts that around 2.8 million\nhectares of corn will be planted later in 2016, under normal climatic conditions, which is about 10\npercent higher than the five year average in area planted. Under normal climatic conditions and taking\ninto account the subsistence farming sector, South Africa’s corn crop for the 2016/17 MY could reach\n12.6 million tons.\nThe CEC released its sixth estimate for the 2015/16 MY corn crop on June 28. According to the CEC,\nSouth Africa’s commercial corn crop is estimated at 7.2 million tons on 1.9 million hectares. The CEC\nalso estimated the subsistence farmer’s production at 435,740 tons on 266,130 hectares. This sets South\nAfrica’s total corn crop for the 2015/16 MY at 7.6 million tons on 2.2 million hectares, which is 29\npercent lower than the 2014/15 MY’s crop of 10.6 million tons and almost half that of the 2013/14\nMY’s crop of 15.0 million tons, illustrating the impact of the drought. White corn production is 35\npercent lower than the previous season, while yellow corn production is 22 percent lower.\nGiven the above, post increased its previous total corn crop (including commercial and subsistence\nfarming) estimate by 600,000 tons to 7.6 million tons on 2.2 million hectares (see also Table 1).\nAccording to the South African Grain Information Services (SAGIS) more than 5.0 million tons or\nalmost 75 percent of the estimated corn crop has already been delivered to the commercial market.\nThe following table details area planted and production figures of commercial white corn and yellow\ncorn as well as corn produced by subsistence farmers for the 2014/15 MY (actual), 2015/16 MY\n(estimate) and 2016/17 MY (forecast).\n\nTable 1: Area planted and production of commercial and subsistence corn in South Africa\nArea\nYiel\nProd.\nArea\nYiel\nProd\nArea\nYiel\nProd.\n\n\u000c1,000h\na\nMY\n\nd\nt/ha\n\n1,000\nt\n\n2014/1\n5\n\n1,000h\na\n\nd\nt/ha\n\n.\n1,000\nt\n\n2015/1\n6\n\n1,000ha\n\nd\nt/ha\n\n1,000\nt\n\n2016/1\n7\n\nCommercia\nl corn\nWhite\n\n1,448\n\n3.3\n\n4,735\n\n1,015\n\n3.1\n\nYellow\n\n1,205\n\n4.3\n\n5,220\n\n932\n\n4.4\n\nSub Total\n\n2,653\n\n3.8\n\n9,955\n\n1,947\n\n3.7\n\nSubsistence\ncorn\nWhite\nYellow\nSub Total\nTOTAL\n\n280\n117\n397\n3,050\n\n1.6\n2.0\n1.7\n3.5\n\n443\n232\n675\n10,63\n0\n\n191\n75\n266\n2,213\n\n1.5\n2.0\n1.6\n3.4\n\n3,10\n0\n4,06\n4\n7,16\n4\n\n1,700\n\n4.1\n\n6,900\n\n1,100\n\n4.7\n\n5,200\n\n2,800\n\n4.3\n\n12,10\n0\n\n286\n150\n436\n7,60\n0\n\n200\n100\n300\n3,100\n\n1.5\n2.0\n1.7\n4.1\n\n300\n200\n500\n12,60\n0\n\nSource: SAGIS and CEC\n\nConsumption\nPost kept its previous forecasts of a three percent increase in the commercial demand for corn in the\n2016/17 MY to 10.3 million tons, due to increased production, unchanged. Post expects that South\nAfrica will use 4.9 million tons of corn for human consumption and 5.1 million tons of corn for animal\nfeed, excluding corn utilized by the subsistence farming sectors and commercial on-farm usages. Post\nalso kept its estimate for the commercial demand for corn in the 2015/16 MY unchanged at 10.0 million\ntons, as drought related high corn prices, corn availability and sluggish economic growth will impact\nnegatively on an increased demand for corn.\nThe commercial consumption of corn in the 2014/15 MY was finalized by SAGIS. According to\nSAGIS the commercial consumption of corn increased by 2.5 percent from the 2013/14 MY’s 10.3\nmillion tons to 10.5 million tons. This is also five percent more than post’s pervious consumption\nestimate of 10.0 million tons. However, there was, as expected, a three percent decrease in the human\nconsumption of corn from 4.8 million tons to 4.7 million tons, due to relatively high white corn prices.\nOverall the consumption of white corn decrease by 27 percent from 5.9 million tons in the 2013/14 MY\nto 4.3 million tons in the 2014/15 MY, due to an almost 40 percent drop in production. On the other\nhand, commercial yellow corn consumption increased by 43 percent from the 2013/14 MY’s 4.3 million\ntons to 6.2 million tons, as yellow corn is more readily available on the world markets for imports. The\nusage of corn for animal feed increased by 10 percent to 5.5 million tons and was mainly driven by an\nestimated four percent growth in the South African broiler industry (a major user of yellow corn as feed)\nand the lack of natural pastures, due to the drought, pressuring producers to buy extra feed for their\nanimals.\n\n\u000cTable 2 outlines the commercial consumption for white and yellow corn in South Africa for the 2014/15\nMY (actual), 2015/16 MY (estimate) and 2016/17 MY (forecast).\nTable 2: The commercial consumption of white and yellow corn in South Africa\nCORN\n1,000 Mt\nMY\nHuman\nAnimal\nOther\nTOTAL\n\nWhite\n2014/15\n4,183\n118\n46\n4,347\n\nYellow\n\nTotal\n\nWhite\n\n513\n5,402\n248\n6,163\n\n4,696\n5,520\n294\n10,510\n\n2015/16\n4,050\n50\n100\n4,200\n\nYellow\n\nTotal\n\nWhite\n\n550\n5,050\n200\n5,800\n\n4,600\n5,100\n300\n10,000\n\n2016/17\n4,400\n500\n100\n5,000\n\nYellow\n\nTotal\n\n500\n4,600\n200\n5,300\n\n4,900\n5,100\n300\n10,300\n\nSource: Sagis; Grain SA\nNote: Please note that consumption figures in the PS\u0026D table also include corn utilized by the\nsubsistence farming sectors and commercial on-farm usages.\nTrade\nUnder normal weather, South Africa should return to be a net exporter of corn in the 2016/17 MY on\nhigher production. Post estimates South Africa could export about 1.0 million tons of corn in the\n2016/17 MY.\nFor the 2015/16 MY, post estimates that South Africa will have to import about 3.5 million tons of corn,\nas the drought reduced normal corn production by more than 40 percent. Argentina is South Africa’s\nmost favorable trading partners in terms of yellow corn, while Mexico and the United States are\npreferred suppliers of white corn (see also Table 3). South Africa will continue exporting corn to its\nneighboring countries, which should amount to about 700,000 tons in the 2015/16 MY.\nFor the 2014/15 MY, South Africa imported almost 2.0 million tons of corn to augment local production.\nMost of the imports were yellow corn (1.9 million) and from Argentina (1.1 million tons) and Brazil\n(502,147 tons). South Africa also imported 102,179 tons of white corn, mainly from Mexico and the\nUnited States.

Executive Summary\n\nAfter several delays, nationwide availability of a 7 percent biodiesel blend (B7) began on\nJanuary 1, 2015 intended for on road transport sector. Crude palm oil (CPO) is the feed stock. In 2015,\nwith the national B7 mandate in force, some exports and no imports, biodiesel production was 550\nmillion liters, up from 451 million liters annually under the 5 percent blend mandate the previous year.\nThe introduction of B10, originally scheduled for October 1, 2015, had been delayed due to resistance\nfrom key diesel vehicle manufacturers, claiming the 10 percent blend would have adverse effects on the\nengine and lubrication systems. Manufacturers claimed Palm Methyl Ester biodiesel could potentially\ndamage the diesel engine injection system if the blend exceeds 7%. Interestingly, 95% of all vehicles\non the road in the United States today are approved up to B20. This forced GOM to delay\nimplementation of B10 mandate to the end of 2016. Realistically, with GOM’s unreliable\nimplementation record, Post believes the mandate will likely be implemented in the first quarter of\n2017. To ensure consumer confidence and acceptance of B10 biodiesel, there are suggestions to offer\nboth B10 and B7 at the petrol station (rather than solely B10), as is the case with petrol that offers the\noption of RON95 and RON97 petrol fuels. The GOM is not in favor as it will slow their efforts in\npromoting B10 biodiesel and reduce end stocks of CPO.\nIn addition, GOM extended the biodiesel mandate to the industrial sector that used boilers in their\nprocess, but at the blend rate of 7%. The commercial roll-out for the industrial sector is expected to\ngradually take place in October 2016. Malaysia ended fuel subsidies on December 1, 2014. Since\nthen, the price of fuel is based on the rolling average price of crude oil during the previous month.\nEthanol is not produced in significant commercial quantities as costs are high.\n\nII. Policy and Programs\nUnder the National Biofuel Policy released on March, 21, 2006, the Government of Malaysia’s (GOM)\nobjectives were to use environmentally friendly and sustainable energy sources to reduce dependency\non fossil fuels and to stabilize and boost palm oil prices. Under this plan, biofuels were to be produced\nfor transport, industry, and export, and the GOM would develop home grown biofuel technology and\nsecond generation biofuels. In 2007, Parliament passed the Biofuel Industry Act, which included\nprovisions for the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities to implement a biodiesel blend\nmandate. However, this act excluded ethanol as the source of alternative fuels under the National\nBiofuel Policy.\nAlthough the initial plan was to initiate B5 in 2008, it only began on June 1, 2011. Selected states in\nPeninsular Malaysia, Central region of Negeri Sembilan and Selangor were first to be introduced before\ngradually being introduced to the Southern region of Malacca and Johore on\nJuly 22, 2012, the northern region of Perak, Penang, Kedah and Perlis in October 1, 2013 and east\ncoast states of Pahang and Kelantan on February 1, 2014. Full nationwide implementation covering\nboth Peninsular and East Malaysia was achieved at the end of 2014. With growing CPO stocks and\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nPage 3\n\n\u000cdeclining prices, GOM was pressured to further increase CPO quantity blended for biodiesel, which led\nto the B7 mandate in 2015.\nFull implementation of the B7 blend, boost biodiesel consumption to 525 million liters in 2015. The\nB10 mandate was supposed to have been implemented on July 1, 2016, for the consumer transport\nsector (that covers both road and sea transport) but has been delayed to the end of 2016 (no specific date\nor month were given for the roll-out). Road transport constitutes nearly 80% of usage while sea\ntransport takes up the rest. To further boost demand for biofuels, GOM also promotes the use of B7\nbiofuel for industrial sectors mainly as source of material to heat boilers and generate electricity. The\nroll-out of B7 biofuel for the industrial sector is expected to gradually take place starting on October 1,\n2016. Full implementation of both B10 exclusively for on road sector and B7 for the industrial sector\nwill lead to consumption of biodiesel to increase to 770.7 million liters as reported by the Ministry of\nPlantation Industries and Commodities in their press statement.\nImplementation of B10 exclusively for commercial on-road and sea transport sectors and B7 for the\nindustrial sector are seen as timely by the industry players as these will strengthen the price of CPO and\nreduce end stock of CPO. Even so, the roll-out was delayed as the Ministry of Plantation Industries and\nCommodities needed to consult with relevant automotive manufacturers about acceptance of B10 and\nwith the Federation of Malaysian Manufactures about acceptance of B7 biodiesel for industrial usage.\nIt was unclear from the statement issued by the Ministry of Plantation Industry and Commodity if the\nmajor automotive manufacturers had been consulted as most expressed reservations about the 10\npercent blend. Leading manufacturers even issued press statements claiming the higher blend above\n7% could damage engines and that the availability in Malaysia of B10 could affect warranty coverage.\nWhile GOM will need to assuage car manufacturers’ concerns, they still have great hopes about the\nfuture of using CPO for biodiesel. The recently released Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020) includes a\ngoal to have a B15 transport mandate by year 2020 for on road sector. No details on the implementation\navailable during the press release, nevertheless automotive manufacturers are skeptical on the\nimplementation as the usage of Palm Methyl Ester beyond 7% blending rate will cause problems to the\ninjection system of the diesel engine.\nNeedless to say, distribution, quality control, safety and user education issues need to be overcome to\nsuccessfully reach this level of biodiesel use in the diesel pool. The GOM needs programs to educate on\nthe benefits of biodiesel and to dispel consumer concerns about the potential damage to the engine.\n\nTable 1 - Planned Versus Actual/Expected Roll-out of Blending Requirements\nTransportation Sector\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nIndustrial Sector\nPage 4\n\n\u000cBlend Planned\nGovernment\nRoll-out\n2008\nB5\n\nB7\n\nJanuary 1, 2015\n\nB10\n\nOctober 1, 2015\n\nActual Roll-out\n\nPlanned Government\nRoll-out\n\n2011 (Central region)\n2012 (Southern region)\n2013 (Northern region)\n2014 Nationwide\nJanuary 1, 2015\n\nNone\n\nEnd of 2016 (as\nreported)\n\nNo plans\n\nOctober 1, 2016\n\nExpected\nRoll-out\n\nOctober 1,\n2016\n\n1st quarter 2017\n(realistically)\nB15\n\n2020\n\nNo plans\n\nIII. Gasoline and Diesel Markets\nSales of new vehicles in 2015 increased to 666,674 units, compared to 666,465 in 2014, a marginal\nincrease of 0.03%. For 2016, the figure is forecast to drop for the first time since 2007 to 650,000\nunits. This was attributed to high financing cost, increased prices of new vehicles and difficulties in\nsecuring loans for new vehicles purchases. Incentives for hybrid vehicles which were introduced in\n2013 and 2014 were discontinued in 2015. For Energy Efficient Vehicles (EEV), GOM has introduced\na special tax incentive for locally assembled vehicles with engine capacity below\n1,300 cc horse power, leading to the popularity of such small engine vehicles in Malaysia.\nGasoline powered vehicles remain the most common, accounting for 80 percent of new car sales. Diesel\npowered vehicles are growing slowly. Most diesel vehicles are trucks, buses, and pick-ups.\nAircraft movement in 2015 was 938,713 compared to 928,733 in 2014, a slight increase of 1.1% from\n2014, partly attributed to the opening of the new low cost carrier hub while Malaysia Airlines downsizes\nits operation in the region.\n\nTable 2 - Fuel Use History and Projections\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nPage 5\n\n\u000cFuel Use History (Million Liters)\nCalendar Year\n\n2005\n10,6\n27\n9,69\n4\n6,30\n1\n1,26\n0\n\n2006\n9,73\n0\n9,54\n6\n6,20\n5\n1,24\n1\n\n2007\n11,1\n31\n10,6\n33\n6,91\n1\n1,38\n2\n\n2008\n11,4\n44\n10,2\n47\n6,66\n1\n1,33\n2\n\n2009\n11,3\n46\n9,65\n1\n6,27\n3\n1,25\n5\n\n2010\n12,3\n73\n9,37\n6\n6,09\n4\n1,21\n9\n\n2011\n10,5\n55\n9,73\n8\n6,33\n0\n1,26\n6\n\n2012\n11,5\n44\n9,78\n9\n6,36\n3\n1,27\n3\n\n2013\n16,3\n80\n10,6\n95\n6,95\n2\n1,39\n0\n\n2014\n16,4\n44\n11,3\n58\n7,38\n3\n1,47\n7\n\n2015\n16,8\n55\n11,5\n28\n7,49\n3\n1,49\n9\n\nShipping \u0026 Rail\n\n485\n1,26\n0\n\n477\n1,24\n1\n\n532\n1,38\n2\n\n512\n1,33\n2\n\n483\n1,25\n5\n\n469\n1,21\n9\n\n487\n1,26\n6\n\n489\n1,27\n3\n\n535\n1,39\n0\n\n568\n1,47\n7\n\n576\n1,49\n9\n\nIndustry\n\n388\n\n382\n\n425\n\n410\n\n386\n\n375\n\n390\n\n392\n\n428\n\n454\n\n461\n\nHeating\n\n0\n2,77\n1\n23,0\n92\n\n0\n2,43\n5\n21,7\n11\n\n0\n2,51\n8\n24,2\n82\n\n0\n2,64\n9\n24,3\n40\n\n0\n2,61\n6\n23,6\n13\n\n0\n3,01\n8\n24,7\n67\n\n0\n2,78\n9\n23,0\n82\n\n0\n2,92\n2\n24,2\n55\n\n0\n3,67\n3\n30,7\n48\n\n0\n3,77\n9\n31,5\n81\n\n0\n3,85\n7\n32,2\n40\n\n2016\n17,2\n76\n11,7\n01\n7,60\n6\n1,52\n1\n\n2017\n17,7\n08\n11,8\n77\n7,72\n0\n1,54\n4\n\n2018\n18,1\n51\n12,0\n55\n7,83\n6\n1,56\n7\n\n2019\n18,6\n05\n12,2\n36\n7,95\n3\n1,59\n1\n\n2020\n19,0\n70\n12,4\n19\n8,07\n3\n1,61\n5\n\n2021\n19,5\n47\n12,6\n06\n8,19\n4\n1,63\n9\n\n2022\n20,0\n35\n12,7\n95\n8,31\n7\n1,66\n3\n\n2023\n20,5\n36\n12,9\n87\n8,44\n1\n1,68\n8\n\n2024\n21,0\n50\n13,1\n81\n8,56\n8\n1,71\n4\n\n2025\n21,5\n76\n13,3\n79\n8,69\n6\n1,73\n9\n\n2026\n22,1\n15\n13,5\n80\n8,82\n7\n1,76\n5\n\n585\n\n594\n\n603\n\n612\n\n621\n\n630\n\n640\n\n649\n\n659\n\n1,52\n1\n468\n\n1,54\n4\n475\n\n1,56\n7\n482\n\n1,59\n1\n489\n\n1,61\n5\n497\n\n1,63\n9\n504\n\n1,66\n3\n512\n\n1,68\n8\n519\n\n1,71\n4\n527\n\n669\n1,73\n9\n\n679\n1,76\n5\n\n535\n\n543\n\n0\n3,93\n9\n32,9\n17\n\n0\n4,01\n7\n33,6\n02\n\n0\n4,10\n0\n34,3\n06\n\n0\n4,18\n5\n35,0\n26\n\n0\n4,27\n2\n35,7\n61\n\n0\n4,36\n0\n36,5\n12\n\n0\n4,45\n0\n37,2\n80\n\n0\n4,54\n3\n38,0\n66\n\n0\n4,63\n7\n38,8\n68\n\n0\n4,73\n3\n39,6\n88\n\n0\n4,83\n2\n40,5\n27\n\nGasoline Total\nDiesel Total\nOn-road\nAgriculture\nConstruction \u0026\nMining\n\nJet Fuel Total\nTotal Fuel\nMarkets\n\nFuel Use Projections (Million Liters)\nCalendar Year\nGasoline Total\nDiesel Total\nOn-road\nAgriculture\nConstruction \u0026\nMining\nShipping \u0026 Rail\nIndustry\nHeating\nJet Fuel Total\nTotal Fuel\nMarkets\n\nIV. Ethanol\nThere is no significant production of ethanol in Malaysia using biomass. Although there are initiatives\nto produce ethanol from palm oil mill effluent (POME), lack of advanced technology and high capital\ninvestment make it infeasible. In addition, difficulties in sourcing a constant supply of feedstock pose\nsignificant challenges. As such, ethanol is not used as a source for fuel, other industrial chemicals and\neven as beverages.\n\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nPage 6\n\n\u000cV.\n\nBiodiesel\n\nTable 3 - Biodiesel supply and demand\nBiodiesel (Million Liters)\nCalendar Year\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n15\n\n3\n\n3\n\n33\n\n141\n\n255\n\n390\n\n376\n\n206\n\n299\n\n186\n\n247\n\n127\n\n188\n\n271\n\n513\n\n451\n\n550\n\n833\n\n960\n\nImports\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nExports\n\n198\n\n247\n\n97\n\n54\n\n32\n\n190\n\n95\n\n195\n\n210\n\n250\n\nConsumption\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n26\n\n125\n\n188\n\n370\n\n525\n\n530\n\n770\n\nEnding Stocks\n\n3\n\n3\n\n33\n\n141\n\n255\n\n390\n\n376\n\n206\n\n299\n\n239\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n2,880\n\n6.5%\n\n8.6%\n\n4.4%\n\n6.5%\n\n9.4%\n\n17.8%\n\n15.7%\n\n19.1%\n\n28.9%\n\n33.3%\n\n222\n\n95\n\n96\n\n103\n\n329\n\n263\n\n361\n\n341\n\n379\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n85\n\n125\n\n188\n\n370\n\n525\n\n530\n\n770\n\n6,661\n\n6,273\n\n6,094\n\n6,330\n\n6,363\n\n6,952\n\n7,383\n\n7,493\n\n7,606\n\n7,720\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n1.3%\n\n2.0%\n\n2.7%\n\n5.0%\n\n7.0%\n\n7.0%*\n\n10.0%\n\n10,247\n\n9,651\n\n9,376\n\n9,738\n\n9,789\n\n10,695\n\n11,358\n\n11,528\n\n11,701\n\n11,877\n\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\n\nBalance Check\nProduction Capacity\nNumber of Biorefineries\nNameplate Capacity\nCapacity Use (%)\n\nFeedstock Use for Fuel (1,000 MT)\nCrude Palm Oil\n\n195\n\nMarket Penetration (Million Liters)\nBiodiesel, on-road use\nDiesel, on-road use\nBlend Rate (%)\nDiesel, total use\n\n* For 2016 the B10 mandate reportedly expected to start at the end of 2016, but realistically Post believes it will\nonly happen during the 1st quarter of 2017. As such, the B7 mandate is expected to last until the end of calendar\nyear 2016.\n\nProduction\nProduction of biodiesel in Malaysia is still far below full capacity. Introduction of the B10 mandate\naccounted for the utilization rate at 33% which is way below industry full capacity.\nDue to industry overcapacity and GOM’s freezing issuances of new licenses for biofuel processing\nplant, Post foresees there will be no expansion in biofuel blending plant capacity in Malaysia, both in\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nPage 7\n\n\u000cthe short and medium terms. Some of the plants even converted to produce other olio-chemical\nproducts. Based on observation by Post and interviews with industry stakeholders, most of the biofuel\nplants in Malaysia operate below capacity. Nearly three-quarters of those biofuel plants registered do\nnot produce biodiesel (Palm Methyl Ester), instead producing other oleo-chemical products such as fatty\nacids, fatty alcohol, soap noodles and glycerine. (See plant listing in Appendix A.)\nAs for the implementation of the B15 transport mandate by year 2020, the utilization rate of biofuel\nproduction capacity will still fall below 65% unless plants are decommissioned; plants are converted to\nthe production of other products; or there is further growth in net trade surplus.\n\nPalm Methyl Ester 100% concentration before\nit is blended with diesel and sold at petrol stations\nin Malaysia.\n(Source: FAS Kuala Lumpur)\n\nMalaysian palm plantation, source of crude palm oil used to\nproduce Palm Methyl Ester (Biodiesel).\n(Source: FAS Kuala Lumpur)\n\nConsumption\nThe average national blend of biodiesel in Malaysia’s transport diesel pool has steadily increased since\n2011. From 1.3% in 2011 (where biofuel was only available in the central region of Negeri Sembilan\nand Selangor states), it increased to 2.0% in 2012 when biofuel was available in the Southern region of\nMalacca and Johore states. When the government fully committed to implement B5 program in 2014, it\nincreased to 5% (nationwide implementation). After many delays, GOM introduced the B7 mandate in\n2015, thus increased the national blend rate to 7%.\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nPage 8\n\n\u000cThe delayed introduction of B10 mandate from July 1, 2016, to the end of 2016, but probably sometime\nduring the first quarter of 2017 means that for calendar year 2016, Malaysia’s national blend rate is at\n7.0% with consumption of 530 million liters. For 2017, the average blend rate is forecast at 10% with\nconsumption forecasted at 770 million liters.\nAlthough the government committed to implement B15 transport mandate in 2020, it is hard to judge if\nthis goal will be reached because the government has not met past deadlines. For example, as\npreviously noted, B10 blending which was supposed to occur on July 1, 2016, was reportedly postponed\nto end of 2016 due to objections by industry stakeholders. Realistically, Post believes it will only\nhappen on the first quarter of 2017. Key to meeting higher targets is the availability of CPO at\ncompetitive prices (domestic and imported), and the readiness to import biodiesel during periods of\nfeedstock scarcity. Also key is a stronger program to address distribution, quality control, safety and\nuser education.\nThe delay in the implementation of B10 mandate from initially October 2015, to the end of 2016, was\ndue, as stated, to concerns from vehicle suppliers about the alleged adverse impact of biodiesel on diesel\nengine performance. Several major vehicle suppliers issued press statements with scientific research.\nAlthough vehicle suppliers were against the 10% blend rate, GOM, nevertheless, proceeded with the\nB10 mandate, and it is uncertain who will take responsibility for any potential vehicle engine problems.\nTo ensure a successful transition to higher blending, the government needs to supply consistently highquality fuels and educate consumers on the use of higher blends. Transparency in research finding and\nactive engagement with industry players, mainly vehicle manufactures, biodiesel producers, fuel\ndistributors and fleet managers, is the best way to ensure success.\nTrade\nExports of biodiesel in 2015 increased to 195 million liters from 95 million liters in 2014. The increase\nwas partly due to the Indonesian government’s increased biodiesel consumption in 2015, hence, reduced\nIndonesian exports of biodiesel. In addition, there was a drastic drop in value of Malaysian currency\nrelative to major trading currencies in 2015, making exports of biodiesel competitive and cheaper in\nterms of U.S. dollar. Thus, increased the quantity of biodiesel exported by Malaysia.\nIn 2015, Malaysia exported 65 % of biodiesel to Spain, 19% to the Netherlands and 11% to Switzerland.\nExports for the first 5 months of the calendar year was 35 million liters which was slightly lower than\n44.14 million liters recorded during the same period of 2015 (January thru May). These were due to\nstrengthening of the Malaysian currency value and increase in price of CPO in recent months, compared\nto CPO prices recorded in 2015.\n\nGAIN REPORT: Biofuels Annual 2016 – MY6004\n\nPage 9\n\n\u000cCOUNTRY\nEuropean Union\nChina P.R\nJapan\nIndia\nHong Kong\nSouth Korea\nSingapore**\nTOTAL\n\nCOUNTRY\nSpain\nNetherlands\nGermany\nBulgaria\nSwitzerland\nChina P.R\nJapan\nIndia\nUSA\nSingapore **\nTOTAL\n\n2014\nQuantity (Tons)\n79,750\n1,598\n1,021\n1,010\n101\n81\n3,794\n87,355\n\n2015\nQuantity (Tons)\n116,960\n34,768\n691\n21\n19,552\n1,741\n2,662\n203\n167\n2,177\n178,942\n\n2014\nQuantity (Mill Liters)\n86.8\n1.7\n1.1\n1.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.13\n95\n\n2015\nQuantity (Mill Liters)\n127.4\n37.9\n0.7\n0\n21.4\n1.9\n2.9\n0.2\n0.1\n2.4\n195\n\n(Source: Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB))\n**Mainly for re-export\n\nStocks\nThere are no significant changes in stock.

From now on, the supply of bioethanol has to be divided in half between the sugar industry and the\ngrain ethanol sector. As in past years, there is no trade in ethanol. Biodiesel production for 2017 is forecast to\nincrease to 3.1 billion liters, a new record. This is a result of the combination of a record domestic demand and\na rebound of exports. Argentina does not import biodiesel, but it is a major world exporter. The United States is\nexpected to be the number one destination in 2016 and 2017, followed by Peru. Exports to the EU, impacted by\nanti-dumping duties in 2013, could slowly resume in 2017 with a favorable dispute settlement outcome for\nArgentina.\n\n\u000c\u000cPost:\nBuenos Aires\n\nAuthor Defined:\n\nI.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nSince the beginning of 2007, Argentina has had in place a Biofuels Law which mandates gasoline to be mixed\nwith bioethanol and diesel with biodiesel beginning in 2010. The original mandates were 5 percent each, but\nafter several modifications, gasoline is currently at 12 percent and diesel at 10 percent. Bioethanol is\nsupplied in halves by the sugar industry which primarily uses molasses and sugarcane as feedstocks, and the\ngrain bioethanol industry which uses almost exclusively corn as feedstock. Biodiesel is produced by large\nprocessors that utilize mostly fully integrated vegetable oil crushing plants. While small and medium plants\nwhich are not integrated, buy vegetable oil from the larger plants. Practically all the biodiesel in Argentina is\nproduced from soybean oil. Argentina is one of the world’s top three soybean producers and the number\none exporter of soybean meal and oil. Bioethanol is not exported and will likely not be through 2017 as\nthere is still room to suffice growing domestic demand. More investment in production capacity will be\nnecessary to increase mandates significantly as is being discussed, and especially so given the projected rise\nin gasoline use. Biodiesel exports supported most of the industry’s growth until peaking in 2011. Currently,\nthe main market is the United States, followed by Peru. The EU, once the number one market, has been\nmostly closed for a couple of years, yet there are good prospects for exports to resume in 2017 with a\nfavorable dispute settlement outcome for Argentina in the WTO.\n\nI.\n\nArgentine Policy and Programs\n\nSince 2007, Argentina has in place a regulatory framework to promote the production and use of\nbiofuels. The main objectives of this framework are to diversify the supply of energy, to foster\nenvironmental conservation, and to promote the development of rural areas (primarily nontraditional\nproduction areas), especially for the benefit of small and medium sized agricultural producers. The\nframework focuses on conventional biofuels, and Argentina has a large biodiesel industry based on soybean\noil and a growing ethanol industry based on sugarcane and more recently grains. Current policy does not\ndirectly support second generation or advanced biofuels. However, there are a few government, private\nsector and university programs researching these types of feedstocks and technology.\nIn April 2006, the Argentine Congress passed Law 26,093, which regulates and promotes the production and\nsustainable use of biofuels. This law mandated the use of biofuels beginning in 2010, with an obligatory mix\nof five percent blend of ethanol in gasoline and five percent blend of biodiesel in diesel. This goal was largely\nmet for biodiesel but fell far short for ethanol. Under this law, companies that produce biofuels have three\noptions: 1) to produce for the domestic market, taking advantage of various tax incentives; 2) to produce for\nself-consumption, with similar advantages as option 1; and 3) to produce for the export market, in which\ncase the companies are ineligible for the tax incentives. In February 2007, the Executive Branch, through\n\n\u000cDecree 109, published the regulations for implementing the above law. Salient points of the Argentine\nbiofuel law (and regulations) are:\nChapter I - Creates incentives for production and use of biofuels in the domestic market with a duration of 15\nyears (beginning on the date of the enactment of the law). It establishes that the Secretariat of Energy will\nbe the controlling authority. The oversight of tax breaks will be under the control of the Ministry of\nEconomy. Some of the responsibilities of the controlling authority, in general, are to establish quality levels,\nsecurity conditions, registration of participating companies, approval of projects that benefit from incentives,\nand the percentage blend of biodiesel with diesel and ethanol with gasoline for the domestic market. Every\nyear the Secretariat of Energy will establish the volumes of biofuels needed to comply with the law,\ndetermine and modify the percentage blends, set prices of biofuels for the domestic market, establish\nvolumes, terms and conditions for those producing for their own consumption, and approve exports.\nChapter II - provides details concerning the incentives of the biofuels promotional regime for domestic use.\nTo be eligible for incentives, companies have to operate in Argentina and be dedicated exclusively to biofuel\nproduction, with the majority of the company’s equity in the hands of the government (i.e. government at\neither the national, provincial, or municipal levels) or agricultural producers (and producers’ cooperatives).\nCompanies have to operate under the above regulations and specifications, and will be assigned a\npercentage of the total tax break granted by the Government of Argentina (GOA) --the law gives priority to\nsmall and medium enterprises, farmers, and entities that operate in nontraditional production areas.\nBiofuels governed by this promotional regime will be exempt from three specific taxes applied to fossil fuels.\nIn addition, biofuel producers for the domestic market will enjoy tax breaks and other advantages (e.g.\nanticipated reimbursement of the value added tax or accelerated depreciation on capital investment).\nEventually, Chapter II leaves open the possibility for producers to receive direct subsidies.\n\nPolicy/Regulatory Developments Since 2007\nIn January 2008, Congress passed Law 26,334, which promoted the production of bioethanol from\nsugarcane. This law allowed sugar mills to participate under the biofuel promotional regime, maintaining the\nbasic norms and regulations of the biofuel law. It also promoted exports of surplus ethanol.\nIn August 2012, the GOA made important changes to the biodiesel policy by reducing the official domestic\nprice leaving aside the original formula (which took into account production costs) to calculate the price,\nwhich is announced every month.\nIn December 2012 the GOA announced a new price scheme for biodiesel for the local mandate, based on the\nsize of the plants. It set a higher price for biodiesel processors of up to 20,000 tons/year, a lower price for\nprocessors of up to 100,000 tons a year and an even lower price for large companies (most big exporters)\nwith production over 100,000 tons/year. In September 2013 the government created a new category of\nlarge plants called “nonintegrated” (which need to purchase the feedstock from third parties). These prices\nhave fluctuated since the implementation of the program, while prices through June 2016 were US$790 per\nton (AR$11,849 per ton) for small plants, US$780 per ton (AR$11,706 per ton) for medium plants, US$702\nper ton (AR$10,532 per ton) for large “nonintegrated” plants, and US$611 per ton (AR$9,160 per ton) for\nlarge companies.\nIn December 2013 the GOA announced that the mandatory biodiesel blend would be increased to nine\n\n\u000cpercent in January 2014 and to ten percent in February 2014. In this announcement it also included, for the\nfirst time, a ten percent blend to use in heating power plants. The Secretariat of Energy, through Resolution\n44/2014 increased the blend mandate for ethanol to a minimum of ten percent by December 2014. None of\nthese goals were met. In 2015, the effective average bioethanol blending mix was 9.4 percent and 8.4 for\nbiodiesel.\nIn mid-2014, Congress passed Law 23996 suspending until the end of 2015 a 19 percent tax on local biodiesel\nsold at the pump and a 22 percent tax on biodiesel to subsidize power generation. The idea was that this\nsuspension will last until the countervailing duties applied by the EU to Argentine biodiesel are removed.\nThrough Decree 630 these exemptions were extended until December 31, 2016.\nIn September 2014, through Resolution 44/14, the Secretariat of Energy created a differentiated price for\nethanol depending on the feedstock used (until then, there was only one price). Therefore, through the\npublication of new price formulas, grain ethanol was priced lower than that of sugarcane ethanol. In\nDecember 2014 the first differentiated price was published. In June 2016 the official price for grain ethanol\nwas US$791 per ton (AR$11,872) and US$852 per ton (AR$12,774) for sugarcane ethanol.\nIn December 2015 new President Macri took office after a tight election against the official candidate of the\ngovernment which ruled the country in the past 12 years. As promised in the campaign, the government got\nrid of the capital controls with an immediate devaluation of the peso of about 40-45 percent against the US\ndollar. It also eliminated export taxes on all crop commodities (corn went from 20 percent to zero), except\nfor the soybean complex which were reduced by 5 percentage points (beans dropped from 35 percent to 30\npercent, and oil and meal from 32 percent to 27 percent).\nIn April 2016, Resolution 37 of the Ministry of Energy established that gasoline had to be mixed at a\nminimum with 12 percent bioethanol and diesel mixed with a minimum 10 percent biodiesel. In the case of\nbioethanol, the additional increase of 2 percentage points has to be supplied by the sugar industry. From\nnow on the grain industry and the sugar industry will have to split in halves the total supply of bioethanol to\nlocal gasoline distributors. Some comments of government officials indicate that the mandates for biodiesel\nand bioethanol could be increased to 20 percent in a “few years’ time”. The Ministry of Energy is working\ntogether with car manufacturers and the National Institute of Industrial Technology to analyze the feasibility\nof reaching such levels of blending.\nIn June 2016 the GOA announced an increase of the export tax on biodiesel to 5.04 percent (from 3.96\npercent in May). A factor which contributed to the expansion of the local biodiesel industry since its\nbeginnings has been the differential export tax on biodiesel vis-à-vis soybean oil. Soybean oil exports are\ncurrently taxed 27 percent while biodiesel exports are taxed 5.04 percent. Since 2012, the GOA has in place\na “flexible export tax system” for biodiesel. In the last 12 months the government has modified the export\ntax on a monthly basis. The local industry claims that due to the nature of their business they need the\nexport tax to remain fixed at least for 6 month increments.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nThere are no specific official environmental or social/economic sustainability criteria for biofuels in\nArgentina. However, being a major exporter of biodiesel, the GOA closely monitors other countries’ criteria\nand regulations in order to avoid restrictions on Argentine exports.\n\n\u000cThe EU established through its Climate and Energy Package that biodiesel from soybean oil does not meet\nthe minimum GHG emissions savings level. Argentina challenged this decision. The GOA presented a study\nprepared by its Agricultural Research Institute (INTA), in which it takes into account the extensive adoption\nof no-till cropping, the short distance from the farms to crushing facilities, refining and port facilities, and its\nmodern and efficient industries. CARBIO, the Argentine Chamber of Biodiesel, has presented to the EU a\nvoluntary certification scheme addressing all their requirements. So far, none of the two have been officially\nrecognized by the EU, but while markets were open, exports were accompanied by certificates\ndemonstrating land use and GHG emissions.\nIn the case of the United States, in mid- 2009, the GOA presented comments to the Environmental\nProtection Agency’s (EPA) Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives, and the changes to the U.S. Renewable\nFuel Standards (RFS). It showed that Argentine soybean-based biodiesel reduced GHG emissions far more\nthan the established 22 percent. EPA’s rulemaking currently establishes that soybean-based biodiesel meets\nthe 50 percent reduction in GHG emissions required to qualify for the biomass-based diesel category, but\nforeign supplies must still prove that land used to supply biofuel feedstock was cultivated prior to 2007 and\nthat a robust monitoring and tracking system is in place to insure no direct land use change. In September\n2012, the Argentine biodiesel chamber (CARBIO) consortium presented EPA a certification scheme\ndemonstrating that Argentina could export biodiesel made of soybeans produced in land which was not\ncultivated or cleared after 2007 and hence be eligible to generate RINs and meet obligations (mandates)\nunder the RFS. In late January 2015, EPA approved CARBIO’s certification scheme. However, there were\nseven local large biodiesel export plants registered with EPA well before CARBIO’s approval. So far none is\nexporting under CARBIO’s umbrella and they all use individual recordkeeping. Already in 2013 one of these\nplants exported a small volume which generated RINs. Efforts aimed at de-authorizing the CARBO\ncertification scheme while the seven large plants remain eligible to generate RINs will not adversely impact\nArgentine biodiesel shipments to the United States.\n\nResearch Initiatives/Alternative Energy Policies\nUnder Law 26,190 of 2006, named National Support for the Use of Renewable Energy Sources, and its\nregulatory framework established in 2009, the GOA created program Genren (Renewable Generation). Its\nobjectives were to produce 895 Mega Watts (MW) in a sustainable manner, reducing emissions of carbon\ndioxide and other GHG, diversifying Argentina’s energy matrix, while promoting regional economies\nthroughout the country. The Law established that eight percent of the country’s electricity consumption be\nsupplied by renewable energy sources (including wind, biofuels, biomass, photovoltaic, solar and small hydro\npower projects) by 2016. However, this goal has yet not been reached. Through mid-2016 only 2 percent of\nthe country’s total electricity consumption is generated sustainably. In 2010 the GOA announced a second\nstage Genren II, for 1200 MW, exclusively for wind energy. In September 2015 Congress passed Law 27,191,\nmodifying Law 26,190. The new law establishes that by the end of 2017 eight percent of the electricity\nconsumed in the country has to be originated from renewable sources and by 2025 it has to account for 20\npercent. There is currently a lot of interest of local and foreign investors in expanding, especially, the\nproduction of energy through wind and sun.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, through the research agency INTA, conducts and coordinates most of the\nresearch in biofuels in Argentina. The National Bioenergy Program goals are to ensure the supply of sources\nof bioenergy in support of sustainable development, national energy security, the reduction of poverty, the\nattenuation of climate change and environmental equilibrium. There are three specific objectives: 1)\n\n\u000cidentification and characterization of the potential of different crops, waste and byproducts to produce\nenergy, 2) the study and development of non-traditional crops with energy potential, and 3) the\ndevelopment of second generation biofuels, through the identification of new enzymes to degrade cellulose.\nINTA is currently working on several projects which involve the production of different feedstocks and also\nthe industrialization and processes to obtain biofuels. Recent examples of these are: “Biodiesel for Selfconsumption”; “Anaerobic Digestion in the Agro Industrial Sector”; “Second Generation Bioethanol”;\n“Evaluations of Sorghum for the Use in Bioethanol”; “Adaptability and Potentiality of Topinambur”; and “The\nuse of Agro Industrial and Urban Waste”.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and the Secretariat of Energy manage a project called Probiomasa, with the\nobjective of producing electric and thermal energy using biomass feedstock from the agricultural and\nforestry sectors, and urban waste. With several projects in 12 different provinces, the program provides\nfunding support for foundations and bases to launch targeted projects. Through February 2016, there were\nmore than 130 projects, of which approximately 60 were already operating and 13 were under construction.\nThere are also provincial entities, public and private universities, and the private sector working on different\nprojects. Some of these programs focus on jatropha, algae, castor oil plant, canola, sweet sorghum and\nmiscanthus. Research is primarily focused on feedstocks which can be produced in areas not suited for crop\nproduction and which do not compete with food production. A few programs are working on cellulosic\nbiofuels, based on sugar cane, sugar beets, harvest residues, sweet sorghum, and switch grass. There are\nalso a few industries and municipalities developing biogas facilities to use waste and reduce the cost of\nenergy they consume. There are also some small operations which recycle used vegetable oil.\nSince 2009 Argentina is a member of the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) which promotes bioenergy for\nsustainable development. The government received financial support from the IDB and coordinated\npublic/private studies of 24 sustainability indicators for bioenergy. The results were published in November\n2015.\n\nI.\n\nGasoline and Diesel Markets\n\nFuel Use Table\nFuel Use History (Million Liters)\nCalendar\nYear\nGasoline\nTotal\nDiesel\nTotal\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n3,698\n12,24\n0\n\n4,260\n13,02\n6\n\n4,970\n14,48\n7\n\n5,520\n14,56\n8\n\n5,760\n13,73\n5\n\n6,240\n15,45\n1\n\n6,970\n16,23\n2\n\n7,470\n15,34\n5\n\n8,160\n16,34\n0\n\n8,080\n15,21\n4\n\n8,510\n15,91\n0\n10,02\n0\n\nOn-road\nAgriculture\nConstructio\nn \u0026 Mining\nShipping \u0026\nRail\nIndustry\n\n3,200\n\n0\n\n96\n\n627\n\n718\n\n975\n\n1,671\n\n2,022\n\n1,817\n\n2,590\n\n1,794\n\n490\n2,200\n\nHeating\nJet Fuel\nTotal\nTotal Fuel\n\n15,93\n\n17,28\n\n19,45\n\n20,08\n\n19,49\n\n21,69\n\n23,20\n\n22,81\n\n24,50\n\n23,29\n\n24,42\n\n\u000cMarkets\n\n8\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\nFuel Use Projections (Million Liters)\nCalendar\nYear\nGasoline\nTotal\nDiesel\nTotal\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n9,600\n18,60\n0\n\n2020\n10,10\n0\n19,53\n0\n\n2021\n10,60\n0\n20,46\n0\n\n2022\n11,10\n0\n21,50\n0\n\n2023\n11,70\n0\n22,55\n0\n\n2024\n12,25\n0\n23,70\n0\n\n2025\n12,90\n0\n24,85\n0\n\n2026\n13,50\n0\n26,12\n0\n\n8,300\n15,92\n0\n\n8,700\n16,85\n0\n\n9,150\n17,66\n0\n\n24,22\n0\n\n25,55\n0\n\n26,81\n0\n\n28,20\n0\n\n29,63\n0\n\n31,06\n0\n\n32,60\n0\n\n34,25\n0\n\n35,95\n0\n\n37,75\n0\n\n39,62\n0\n\nOn-road\nAgriculture\nConstructio\nn \u0026 Mining\nShipping \u0026\nRail\nIndustry\nHeating\nJet Fuel\nTotal\nTotal Fuel\nMarkets\n\nSource: History (private sector based on data from Secretary of Energy; Projection (Post based on private and\nofficial sectors)\n\nIn 2015, Argentina consumed 15.9 billion liters of diesel, of which 2.2 billion liters were used to generate\nelectricity, and 8.5 billion liters of gasoline. The country was energy self-sufficient until several years ago.\nThe combination of declining oil and gas production coupled with growing demand forces the country to\nimport gas, gasoline, and diesel. Large car sales in the past several years, plus a strong recovery of the\nagricultural sector are expected to secure steady diesel and gasoline demand from 2017 and beyond as the\nlocal economy is expected to rebound strongly.\nAs for 2016, the demand of gasoline is expected to drop marginally, while demand of diesel could remain\nunchanged while economy reacts through strong adjustments and a recession. There are no flex fuel cars\nsold in the country and only one automaker imports a hybrid model, sold at a very expensive price.\nHowever, the use of flex fuel cars in the near future should not be discarded. In 2010, Argentina discovered\na huge shale oil and shale gas field, named Vaca Muerta. This non-conventional energy source in the\nprovince of Neuquen is the third largest of its kind in the world. However, until it goes into production (a\nminimum of five years and several billion dollars of investment needed), most analysts project Argentina\nexpanding its energy imports. Sources report that lower world oil prices are expected to slow down\ninvestment in this area.\n\nIV.Ethanol\n\nCalendar Year\n\n2008\n\nBeginning Stocks\nFuel Begin Stocks\n\n0\n\nProduction\n\nEthanol Used as Fuel (Million Liters)\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n0\n\n20\n\n25\n\n28\n\n38\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n35\n\n43\n\n54\n\n44\n\n\u000cFuel Production\n\n0\n\n23\n\n125\n\n173\n\n250\n\n472\n\n671\n\n815\n\n880\n\n1,040\n\nFuel Imports\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nImports\n\nExports\nFuel Exports\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nConsumption\nFuel Consumption\n\n0\n\n3\n\n120\n\n170\n\n240\n\n475\n\n663\n\n804\n\n890\n\n1,040\n\nEnding Stocks\nFuel Ending Stocks\n\n0\n\n20\n\n25\n\n28\n\n38\n\n35\n\n43\n\n54\n\n44\n\n44\n\n9\n215\n58%\n\n9\n355\n49%\n\n11\n600\n42%\n\n12\n680\n69%\n\n14\n880\n76%\n\n14\n950\n86%\n\n17\n1,250\n70%\n\n17\n1,250\n83%\n\n0\n\n0\n\n18\n\n130\n\n285\n\n370\n\n340\n\n400\n\n0\n470\n\n0\n650\n\n58\n880\n\n420\n1,170\n\n920\n1,150\n\n1,200\n1,300\n\n1,100\n1,700\n\n1,300\n2,000\n\n120\n6,240\n1.9%\n\n170\n6,970\n2.4%\n\n240\n7,470\n3.2%\n\n475\n8,160\n5.8%\n\n663\n8,080\n8.2%\n\n804\n8,510\n9.4%\n\n890\n8,300\n10.7%\n\n1,040\n8,700\n12.0%\n\nProduction Capacity\nNumber of Refineries\n0\n3\nNameplate Capacity\n0\n120\nCapacity Use (%)\n0\n19%\nCo-product Production (1,000 MT)\nDistill Grain Sol Dry Eq\n0\n0\nFeedstock Use for Fuel (1,000 MT)\nGrains (corn)\n0\n0\nMolasses/Juice\n0\n90\nMarket Penetration (Million Liters)\nFuel Ethanol\n0\n3\nGasoline\n5,520\n5,760\nBlend Rate (%)\n0.0%\n0.1%\n\nProduction\nEthanol production for 2017 is forecast to increase to a record 1.04 billion liters. This is a result of the recent\nincrease in the domestic blend mandate from a minimum of 10 to 12 percent in gasoline and greater fuel\ndemand. Of total ethanol production in 2017, half should originate from sugar supplies and the other half\nfrom grain supplies. The new government supports the bioethanol industry and believes this sector can be\npart of the solution to increase domestic fuel supply and help limit the large volume of imported fuel which\nis very costly to the country. Contacts indicate that the government is seriously analyzing the launching of\nflex fuel cars in the next few years. The local car industry already produces these types of cars for export to\nthe Brazilian market. However, the logistics and adjustments of supplying E100 at the pump is expected to\ntake several years and costs are significant.\nThere are nine local sugar mills located in the north western provinces which have quota to supply under the\nmandate. Mills use mostly molasses but also can use directly sugarcane, depending on the convenience and\nreturns of their different businesses. Sugar is the main focus of the large mills, but due to recent low world\nsugar prices and good domestic ethanol prices they have lately focused more in expanding the ethanol\nbusiness. The recent increase of 2 percentage points of the mandate was given exclusively to the sugar\nindustry. By doing this, the government helped them to reduce part of the large sugar stocks they were\nholding and allows mills to increase their share of an increasingly profitable business. There are three sugar\nmills expected to begin supplying ethanol under the mandate quota in 2016 which did not participate\npreviously. These companies are in Tucuman province and in the first stage they are expected to use a third\ncompany to dehydrate the ethanol.\nThe other half of bioethanol supplies for the domestic mandate has to be supplied by the grain ethanol\nindustry. There are five plants distributed in the main corn area in the center of the country. Although most\nplants can use different feedstocks, they use almost exclusively corn which happens to be the most efficient\nunder current market conditions. Argentina produces and exports significant volumes of sorghum, but so far\n\n\u000cits use for bioethanol production has been insignificant. There are a few projects of small plants based on\ncorn to produce ethanol for self-consumption (integrated to feedlots) and small plants to generate electricity\nfor self-consumption and/or connect to the grid. As in the sugarcane ethanol sector, the corn ethanol\nindustry continues to be profitable.\nThe country’s production capacity of bioethanol is expected to increase to 1.25 billion liters in 2016, once the\nthree sugar mills begin to supply ethanol for the mandate. The original nine sugar mills have a production\ncapacity of bioethanol of approximately 450-500 million liters a year. The five plants which utilize grain as\nfeedstock have a production capacity of approximately 550 million liters a year. The latter plants supplied 59\npercent of the country’s bioethanol in 2015. The first of the grain ethanol plants were inaugurated in 2012,\nand the most recently in late 2014. Argentina also produces some 130 million liters of alcohol for industrial\nand potable use (not included in the ethanol table) for its domestic market. Most production is made by\nsugar mills, but there is a plant which inaugurated in 2012 in Cordoba which utilizes grains and has a\nproduction capacity of 50 million liters a year. The main use of this alcohol is for beverages, pharmaceutical,\ncleaning, cosmetics, and paints.\nAlmost all grain processing plants dry the distillers grains (DDGS). However, a few plants cannot dry their\ntotal volume so they sell part as wet distiller’s grain to nearby feedlots or dairies. DDGS are currently sold\ndomestically to feed mills, feed additive companies and large dairies or feedlots which are far from\nbioethanol plants but still prefer to use them. Three of the plants are currently exporting DDGS to\nneighboring Chile, Uruguay and to South East Asia. Sugar mills continue to make improvements in reducing\nthe negative impact of the vinasse, a byproduct of the distilleries, which is a significant environmental\nproblem which sugar mills are resolving as the GOA continues to exert significant pressure.\nSince December 2015, when the new government took office and eliminated the export tax on corn and\nother agricultural products, local bioethanol processors now purchase corn locally at similar prices to those\nof the world market. The advantage of purchasing corn at a 20 percent discount does not longer exist. Local\ncorn prices have increased 150 percent (in peso terms) since late 2015, while the official price of grain\nbioethanol only by 55 percent. Despite this difference, the industry still enjoys positive returns. In the case\nof bioethanol produced from sugarcane, it allows mills to diversify their production and have an alternative\ndepending on the size of the crop and the level of world sugar prices. Argentina is self-sufficient in sugar and\nnormally has a significant volume of sugar surplus to export. The current sugarcane harvest began in June,\nwith a large carry in from the previous season and expectations of a large production. However, world sugar\nprices have begun to lately increase and could help the industry to improve its difficult economic and\nfinancial situation.\nArgentina is the world’s third largest corn exporter, averaging around 18-22 million tons in the past 3-4\nyears. Domestic consumption ranges between 9-10 million tons a year, with the poultry, feedlot, and dairy\nindustries as the main consumers. The local grain ethanol industry, which is expected to consume roughly\n1.3 million tons of corn in 2017, has lots of room to continue expanding as corn production in Argentina is\nexpected to increase significantly during this crop season and hereafter as result of the government’s new\npolicies for the sector. Sorghum exports are also important, with volumes ranging between 1.5-2.0 million\ntons a year.\n\nConsumption\n\n\u000cArgentine consumption of bioethanol for 2017 is forecast to increase to 1.04 billion liters, a new record. This\nis the result of a full year with the new 12 percent mandate mix (increased in April 2016) and an expected\ngrowth in gasoline demand due to an anticipated rebound in the local economy. The mandate mix for 2016\nis estimated to total approximately 10.7 percent as the first 4 months operated at 10.5 percent. Industry\ncontacts expect to reach the full 12 percent mix rate by August-September this year. The mandate rate in\n2015 was 9.4 percent. Since the implementation of the biofuels law in 2010, bioethanol domestic\nconsumption has grown every year.\nIndustry contacts indicate that the government is working on adapting gasoline specifications and higher\nquality standards which will allow, eventually, a higher content of bioethanol. Car manufacturers are not\nvery supportive of an increase of the mandate blend due to potential problems with engines and the\nextension of warrantees. The local association of grain ethanol indicates that they have done studies which\nshow that gasoline can be blended with 20 percent ethanol without affecting engines. The case of\nneighboring countries Brazil and Paraguay are good cases that support blends of 25-27 percent of ethanol.\nThe country is still working on becoming more fuel efficient. Engines have no limitations on minimum\nmileage efficiency, there are no flex fuel cars sold in the country and hybrid and electrical cars are practically\nnonexistent and do not have import duty advantages. Most cars run on gasoline. However, for some time,\nArgentina has had an extensive fleet of vehicles which run on liquefied petroleum gas. More than 2 million\ncars out of 10 million run on this fuel (which primarily substitutes gasoline). There are several passenger\nrailway lines, with some running on electricity and some on diesel. Cargo lines all run on diesel.\nArgentina has a huge trucking system which has replaced a decaying railway system. The country is\nextensive and boasting a large agricultural sector demands large volumes of diesel to produce and move\ncargo and passengers. The GOA is continuing to revamp some metropolitan railway tracks and more\nrecently, key cargo tracks in agricultural areas in the interior of the country to make freight more efficient\nand less costly.\nTrade\nExports of bioethanol from Argentina are not expected in the near nor medium future. Argentina still has a\nsignificant potential to increase its domestic consumption which enjoys official support that guarantees a\nprofitable business. Bioethanol domestic prices under the mandate are normally higher than world prices.\nAlso greater investment in expanding capacity would be needed to support exports.\nOnce the biofuel mandate was in place in early 2010, Argentine ethyl alcohol exports dropped significantly as\nmost production surplus was redirected to supply the local bioethanol mandate which was more profitable.\nBefore the mandate, Argentina exported 60-80 million liters of ethyl alcohol (not for fuel use) a year.\nExports in 2015 totaled 22 million liters, with Chile and France being the main destination.\nEthanol imports from Mercosur countries (including Brazil) are duty free, and from countries outside the\nblock pay 20 percent. Exports are taxed five percent, but receive a 4.05 percent rebate.\n\nEnding Stocks\nBioethanol ending stocks for 2017 are forecast at 44 million liters. Stocks are mainly in the hands of the local\n\n\u000csugar industry which produces ethanol in the last semester of the year, which then is distributed throughout\nthe following months until the new sugar crop begins in May. The local grain bioethanol industry can have\nby the end of the year some 10 million liters waiting to be distributed immediately as demand at that time of\nthe year is large.\n\nV.

The\nfinal production volume is tied to the country’s domestic use and exports since there are no imports. Exports\ndepend strongly on other countries’ biofuels and trade policies. Biodiesel production for the domestic\nmandate is expected to continue its ascending trend of the past years. Most contacts believe that the US will\ncontinue to import significant volumes of biodiesel to meet increased mandates. They also believe that the\nPeruvian market will continue to be open while exports to the EU will probably resume timidly during 2017.\nProduction in 2016 is estimated at 2.69 billion liters, a substantial increase from the previous year thanks,\nprimarily, to growing exports to the US.\nPractically all biodiesel produced in Argentina is made from soybean oil. The biodiesel business began in\n2007 when large local vegetable oil crushing plants saw the opportunity to add value to the oil and export it\nas biodiesel to the EU. Argentina is one of the world’s three largest soybean producers and the top exporter\nof soybean meal and oil. There is an insignificant volume of biodiesel produced from used cooking oil\nencouraged by several municipalities and some private operations.\nSince its beginning, local biodiesel operations have invested over US$1.5 billion. The current production\ncapacity is approximately 5.4 billion liters and it is expected to remain the same in 2017. Due to the\n\n\u000cdifficulties of the past several years in exporting, investment in expanding has been minimal. The use of\ncapacity during 2010-2012 ranged between 70-84 percent. However, the combination of limitations to\nexport to the EU market and a significant growth in capacity during 2013-2015 made the used capacity drop\nto 40-55 percent. Used capacity in 2017 is forecast at 57 percent, the highest since 2012. While most small\nplants are operating almost at full capacity to supply the local mandate, there are a few large plants which\nhave shut down or are only working a few days a month. New investment is directed primarily to small\nplants.\nThere are 38 biodiesel plants in Argentina with capacity of up to 700 million liters per year. The largest ten\ncompanies account for over 70 percent of the country´s capacity. Most of these companies are international\nand local traders which already had large vegetable oilseed crushing facilities in the country. They account\nfor practically all exports. The balance is distributed among 28 smaller companies, with plants with a capacity\nranging between 12-110 million liters per year. This group supplies most of the local mandate. These plants\ntypically need to buy the feedstock from third parties and have higher production costs than the large plants,\nmost of which are fully integrated.\nThe local biodiesel industry had a difficult 2015 due to small exports and a low domestic official price. The\nused capacity was 40 percent, the lowest since the industry began operating. Currently the sector of small\nand medium companies is in a good situation as the official price is currently profitable for them. The large\nexporting companies area also enjoying positive returns. However, the used capacity for 2016 and 2017 is\nexpected to continue to be low, ranging between 50-57 percent. Most of the big plants are owned by large\ncorporations which have been operating in the local grain sector for many years and do not have biodiesel as\ntheir core business. Several of these plants were built during the first days of the biodiesel industry and have\nalready recovered the investment.\n\nConsumption\nArgentine biodiesel consumption for 2017 is forecast to reach a record 1.4 billion liters. The local economy is\ngoing through significant adjustments implemented by the new government and an economic recession.\nMost economists believe that there will be a strong rebound in 2017, with lower inflation, strong investment\nand a stronger agricultural sector. Post projects a significant growth in diesel consumption and the current\nB10 for on-road transport and agriculture will be maintained at least through 2017 with some additional use\nin agriculture. Post expects only very small volumes of biodiesel will be used in the industrial sector through\n2017 to generate electricity.\nThere are some rumors indicating that the mandate could be increased in the near future to 11 or even 12\npercent. Also some express that the mandate for public transportation, trucking and agriculture should be\nincreased to 20 percent. In late 2013 the government announced that diesel for heat and power generation\nwould be mixed with 10 percent biodiesel. This requirement has been delayed (but not forgotten) as there\nhave been some technical limitations which are being worked on. In July 2016, the state company that\nadministers the wholesale electricity market finished a test in a heat and power plant that was very\nsuccessful and more tests will follow shortly. There are many different technologies and equipment\ninvolved in this sector, as well as a diversity of biodiesel qualities. This sector (“industry” in the fuel table)\nconsumes approximately 2.0-2.5 billion liters of diesel per year. Local biodiesel producers estimate that\nsome 50-100 million liters of biodiesel could be used in the generation of electricity in 2017, but Post has not\nincluded this in the biodiesel balance.\n\n\u000cThere is no official data on diesel consumption per end user in Argentina. However, contacts estimate that\nin 2015, cars demanded 2.0 billion liters, freight trucking 6.7 billion liters, public transportation 1.32 billion\nliters, the agricultural sector 3.2 billion liters, and the shipping industry 490 million liters. Except for the\nlatter, all the other end users consume diesel mixed at the official blend.\nThe country is still working on becoming more fuel efficient. Engines have no limitations on minimum fuel\nmileage efficiency, there are no flex fuel cars sold in the country and hybrid and electrical cars are practically\nnonexistent and do not have import duty advantages. Argentina has an extensive fleet of vehicles which run\non liquefied petroleum gas since long ago. More than 2 million cars out of 10 million run on this fuel. There\nare several railway lines of passengers with some running on electricity and some on diesel. Cargo lines all\nrun on diesel.\nCar manufacturers and oil companies prefer not to increase the blends due to liability concerns, logistical\nproblems, and higher costs. The Argentine chamber of biodiesel has come up with successful results after\ntesting a diesel engine running on 10 and 20 percent biodiesel blends. Most contacts indicate that mandate\nblends will continue to be set by the GOA depending on its needs. If it requires increasing beyond current\nblends the local industry will have to adapt.\n\nTrade\nArgentine biodiesel exports for 2017 are forecast at 1.7 billion liters. This would be the highest volume since\n2014 and only 200 million liters shy of the 2011 record when most shipments went to the EU. Local traders\nexpect most exports to continue flowing to the United States to meet growing mandates and much smaller\nvolumes to Peru. However, exports to Peru will depend on the resolution of a dispute over subsidies and\nantidumping of Argentine biodiesel in Peru. Most local contacts are not optimistic on any significant\nresumption of biodiesel exports to the EU in 2017. In the best case scenario, brokers believe exports could\ntotal 100-200 million liters. Exports of Argentine biodiesel are currently profitable supported by a weaker\ncurrency and access to the US market where the blender’s credit and RINs add value to shipments.\nAs in 2015 and 2016, Argentine biodiesel exports in 2017 will be mainly focused on the US biodiesel market\nwhich benefit from RINs under the RFS and the blenders credit under the IRS tax code. Local brokers\nforecast exports between 1.4-1.5 billion liters next year, the key assumption being that the blender’s credit is\nnot changed to a US producer’s only credit. Exports to the US in 2016 are expected to total 1.3 billion liters.\nIn early 2015, EPA approved a certification scheme presented by the Argentine Biodiesel Chamber (Carbio)\ndemonstrating that it complied with EPA’s environmental regulations and qualified under the U.S.\nRenewable Fuel Standards program. Biodiesel exports have to be segregated and traced back to the farm,\ndemonstrating that the feedstock (soybeans in this case) used to make biodiesel was produced on land not\ncultivated or cleared after 2007 (the year EISA 2007 was enacted). However, local exporters are not using\nthis certification scheme as there are seven processors which are registered individually with EPA and use an\nindividual record keeping system. EPA segregation requirements add an estimated cost of US$30-40 per ton\nof biodiesel. This includes a price premium paid to farmers producing “EPA soybeans”, the cost of\nsegregations and controlling the whole chain until export, the time consumed in the whole process, etc.\nDifferent companies have different problems. The most common are limited supply of traced soybeans,\nsmaller-than-needed biodiesel storage capacity, and logistical complications.\n\n\u000cSources report that foreign (namely US) demand for biodiesel is rising this year and possibly next year as\nArgentine suppliers capitalize on developments in the US biofuels market, in particular expanding US federal\nmandates for biomass-based diesel (BBD) and other (non-cellulosic) advanced biofuel, strong D 4 RIN values,\nthe US blenders tax credit, and a sharply devalued peso. At present, about 23 percent of the U.S. fuel supply\nis diesel used in heavy-duty trucks, buses, construction and farm equipment, and heating oil. However,\ndomestically processed biodiesel in the United States faces imported price-competitive biodiesel and\nrenewable diesel that is more price competitive. According to Bloomberg, biodiesel derived from soybean oil\ncosts US$3.71 a gallon, but imported biodiesel coming through the Gulf of Mexico port costs US$3.07 with\nArgentine supplies up to 30 cents cheaper than that. This presents a significant opportunity for Argentina to\ngain greater market share. In 2015, Argentina was the largest foreign supplier of biodiesel to the US market\nand accounted for 35 percent of total US biodiesel and renewable diesel imports. [1]\nIn the past three years, Peru has been a very steady market for Argentine biodiesel, and emerged as the\nsecond largest market in 2015 following the loss of sales to Europe and loss of discretionary sales supported\nby the price competiveness of lower cost biodiesel and very high oil prices just prior to the oil price collapse.\nPeru as imported roughly 300 million liters a year to supply its official mandate, most of which was supplied\nby Argentina. However, in August 2014 the Peruvian Institute of Defense of Competition and Intellectual\nProperty Protection (INDECOPI) opened an investigation on imports of alleged Argentine subsidized\nbiodiesel. Peruvian biodiesel plants have been idled due to the influx of cheaper foreign suppliers, and this\ninvestigation was requested by the largest Peruvian biodiesel processor. To date Peru has set anti-subsidy\nduties per company ranging between US$15-30 per ton of biodiesel. Regarding the antidumping case,\nPeruvian authorities continue to analyze and work on it. It is unclear what the result will be, but if a\ncountervailing duty is imposed it is expected to affect Argentine exports significantly. To date, Argentina\ncontinues to export biodiesel to Peru.\nIn November 2013 the EU implemented an average countervailing duty of 24.6 percent on Argentine\nbiodiesel due to alleged dumping (provisional anti-dumping duties were established in May 2013). In\npractice, this meant the closing of that market. Argentina appealed such measure before the WTO. In\nMarch 2016 the WTO ruled mostly in favor of Argentina’s position, indicating that the EU had wrongly\ncalculated the tariffs. In late May each country appealed the panel’s ruling, and the appellate body has 90\ndays to issue its report. The sector believes that the EU will have to eliminate or drastically reduce the\nimposed tariffs. On the other hand, on May 2016, Spain eliminated a blockage to imported biodiesel which\nhad come into effect two years ago and affected directly Argentina’s exports. This is very important as Spain\nwas the number one market for Argentine biodiesel exports in the EU and will be able to resume exports to\nthis market once the antidumping issue is resolved. Nonetheless, local brokers believe that exports to the\nEU will restart slowly in 2017 at volumes far smaller than in the past.\nArgentine biodiesel is very competitive as a result of large production scale with the latest technology, the\nuse of no-till and biotechnology seed, and having the soybean production area very close to the industry and\nports. This, and the revaluation of the Argentine peso, is the key sources of Argentina’s biodiesel\ncompetitiveness. To some extent, although how much is hotly debated, Argentina biodiesel exports are also\nsupported by the differential exports tax which is lower on biodiesel than it is for its feedstock (soybean\noil).Argentine biodiesel exports are currently (through June 2016) taxed 5.04 percent. The GOA sets the level\nof the tax every month. Import duties are 14 percent. The export tax on soybeans is 30 percent and\nsoybean oil is 27 percent.\n\n\u000cStocks\nArgentine biodiesel ending stocks for 2017 are forecast at 25 million liters. Local plants do not produce\nbiodiesel for stocks, due to the instability of the product. Normally stocks are volumes waiting to be shipped\nright away.\n\nVI. Advanced Biofuels\nThere is no production so far. However, there are a few government, private sector and university programs\nresearching these types of feedstocks and technology.\n\nVII. Biomass for Heat and Power\nSugar mills in Argentina generate part of their energy needs from bagasse. Four sugar mills have new and\nhigh efficiency generation boilers which allow them to cogenerate energy for their own needs and to sell to\nthe local energy grid. The total capacity of these plants is approximately 100 MW. Other mills have similar\nplans, but investment is coming very slow. There are several projects to produce electricity from woody\nmass in Corrientes and Misiones provinces. There are also some projects to produce energy from residential\nwaste and livestock and oil crushing facilities. Cordoba province recently inaugurated a biogas plant using\nthe fermentation of corn silage with cattle and hog manure. This plant will produce one megawatt per hour\nof electrical power which will be used to feed an ethanol plant and sell to the grid. These plants are\nexpected to be built in several parts of the region.\n\n[1]\n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-21/big-soy-crop-no-help-for-u-s-biofuel-makers-overrun-by-imports\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Biofuels Annual_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-21-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual 2016_Prague_Czech Republic_5-10-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Bangkok_Thailand_7-22-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Kuala Lumpur_Malaysia_7-27-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-25-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-18-2016.txt\nStone Fruit Report 2016_Berlin_Germany_7-21-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\n","title":"Biofuels Annual_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-21-2016.txt","summary":"In June 2016 the GOA announced an increase of the export tax on biodiesel to 5.04 percent (from 3.96\nBefore the mandate, Argentina exported 60-80 million liters of ethyl alcohol (not for fuel use) a year.\nProduction of biodiesel in Argentina in 2017 is forecast to increase to 3.1 billion liters, a new record.\nThere are 38 biodiesel plants in Argentina with capacity of up to 700 million liters per year.\nThe local biodiesel industry had a difficult 2015 due to small exports and a low domestic official price.\noil).Argentine biodiesel exports are currently (through June 2016) taxed 5.04 percent.","keywords":"exports exporter exported export exporters exporting biodiesel argentina production products product plants plant biofuels biofuel local locally","latentTopics":"biodiesel, percent, argentina, exports, liters, local, industry, ethanol, sugar, plants"}

ATO Japan has\nbeen collaborating with Aeon since 2009 to promote U.S. food and agricultural products, providing fresh ideas\nand the starpower of our Agricultural Minister Counselors and Trade Officers. One of the most highly visible and\nsuccessful efforts has been the annual American Fair, typically held in conjunction with the arrival of U.S.\ncherries towards the end of May. Aeon outlets from Hokkaido to Kyushu have capitalized on this annual event to\npromote U.S. foods and introduce a wide variety of new products, including: craft beer, gourmet popcorn, U.S.style barbecue, California olive oil, artisanal U.S. cheeses, and a range of bakery and confectionery recipes. Aeon\nand ATO Japan have also joined up to include complementary product lines like sporting goods, outdoor\nequipment, and apparel to increase foot traffic and enhance food sales numbers.\nThis year’s American Fair events including contributions from the U.S. Meat Export Federation, Alaska Seafood\nMarketing Institute, Sunkist, California Agricultural Export Council, American Cherries, USA Poultry and Egg\nExport Council, Blue Diamond Almond, U.S. Dairy Export Council, California Prune Board, California Walnut\nCommission and Raisin Administrative Committee. At its flagship AEON Laketown mall in nearby Saitama\n(about 30km from central Tokyo), ATO Japan Director Rachel Nelson joined the President of AEON Retail Jerry\nBlack to launch the 2016 American Fair at big promotional event on June 10.

ATO Tokyo also provided a tour of trendy eateries and specialty food\nshops in Brooklyn to introduce a variety of hip, new U.S. food products.\nATO Tokyo coordinated with WUSATA, SUSTA, and Food Export USA to provide\n\n\u000cthe Japanese importers with a list of STRG-sponsored exhibitors featuring such products non-fried chips and\nchocolates. The Japanese importers returned to Japan with bags of samples for further product testing and a\nnumber of new opportunities, flavors and products to follow up on.\n\nA winery (blending in) in Brooklyn\n\nATO Osaka Hosts American Food Seminar: On July 12, ATO\nOsaka educated and entertained more than 80 chefs at the Rihga Royal\nHotel in Osaka for an American Food Seminar \u0026 Reception.\nTargeting Kansai region restaurant and hotel chefs, the event\nintroduced American food items, including innovative U.S. pork cuts,\npotatoes as a main course and Oregon hard ciders. Agricultural\nMinister Counselor David Miller encouraged the crowd to try new\nthings and keep exploring the variety of high quality food and\nagricultural products that the United States has to offer.\nDuring the seminar, the U.S. Meat Export Federation highlighted U.S.\npork, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute described the pristine\nenvironmental conditions and sustainable harvesting practices in Alaska, Potatoes USA underscored the benefits\nof U.S. potatoes, and the California Olive oil Council explained how their strict production standards assure the\nhigh quality of extra virgin olive oil made in California. Following the seminar, high-profile Japanese chef\nJunichiro Horie of restaurant “i-lunga” in Nara led a team of Rihga Royal chefs in preparing a dinner that\nincorporated the four ingredients featured in the seminar and was complemented by a delicious range of Oregon\ncraft ciders. ATO Osaka, with great support from the Oregon State Department of Agriculture and the Northwest\nCider Association, invited hard cider manufacturers from Oregon to pair their ciders with the food at the event in\norder to introduce the Japanese chefs to the boom in American craft cider production and consumption.\nAmerican Hardwood Seminars Attract Record Crowds in Fuchu\nand Sapporo: With robust collaboration from the local governments\nand various wood-related industry associations in these regions The\nAmerican Hardwood Export Council (AHEC) held seminars in Fuchu\n(Hiroshima prefecture) on June 29 and in Sapporo (Hokkaido\nprefecture) on July 1. National Hardwood Lumber Association (NHLA)\nChief Inspector Dana Spessert explained about the U.S. grades and\nlabeling of hardwoods, and Dr. Eva Haviarova of Purdue University\ntalked about kitchen design trends in the United States. Agricultural\nAttaché Jess Paulson traveled to Hiroshima from Tokyo to deliver\nopening remarks at the Fuchu seminar, which drew more than 130 attendees. He welcomed the audience and\nexpressed his appreciation for their continued support for U.S. hardwoods in the region.\n\n\u000cFAS Japan Hosts 140+ Iowa Farm Bureau Federation Members:\nOn July 8, the Office of Agricultural Affairs hosted a country briefing\nfor 142 Members of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation (IFBF) visiting\nJapan as part of their ongoing efforts to better understand the\nindispensable Japanese market and to maintain the historic bonds of\nfriendship with Yamanashi Prefecture. Ambassador Kennedy welcomed\nthe group and received photographs from the historic Yamanashi hog\nlift, when Iowans generously sent 35 breeding sows and 100,000 bushels\nof corn to help the farmers of Yamanashi recover from a devastating\ntyphoon. The IFBF delegation was comprised of IFBF leadership,\nincluding President Craig Hill (pictured above), County Presidents and\ntheir spouses from over 60 counties, and Iowa Sister States Executive\nDirector Kim Heidemann. Agricultural Attaché Evan Mangino provided\nan agricultural briefing and (somewhat) successfully orchestrated the\nsecurity/entrance of the largest visiting group in recent memory. Iowa\nexports more pork and beef to Japan than any other state, topping $580 million in 2015 alone.\n\nEvaluating Japanese Interest in Egg Exports at Major\nLayer Operation: On July 6, FAS Tokyo joined working\nlevel staff from the Ministry of Agricultural, Forestry and\nFisheries (MAFF) and the Ministry of Health, Labour and\nWelfare (MHLW) at TOMARU, one of the largest vertically\nintegrated layer operations in Japan. MAFF and MHLW have\nbeen in consultation with Post regarding access to the U.S.\nmarket for Japanese eggs to be used in Japanese restaurants in\nthe United States. Most Americans are surprised to learn that\neggs feature prominently (often raw) in a number of traditional\nJapanese dishes (such as sukiyaki) and that Japan ranks second\nin the world in per capita egg consumption at more than 17 kg per person each year.\nWith over 90 years of experience as a breeder/hatcher Tomaru,\nin nearby Gunma prefecture, has expanded over the last 30 years\nto include considerable laying, grading and packing capacity.\nWith a wholly owned feed mill under construction and the\nexpansion of laying capacity with the opening of Japan’s largest\nlaying shed (housing 240,000 birds), Tomaru is an example of a\nmodern Japanese agricultural producer that is expanding as\nsmaller, traditional operators continue to exit agricultural\nproduction. Tomaru’s grading and packaging (GP) center\nhandles approximately 120 different brands of fresh eggs and\nships nearly 50 metric tons (MT) of eggs each day from their\nown and nearby layer farms. Depending on the brand and their\nmarketing tactics, the GP center packages eggs for retail in\nplastic clamshells of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 15 eggs, with a standard\n10-egg pack retailing between $1.75 - $2.25.\n***\n\n\u000c","similarList":"The WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nFAS Canada Assists Small U.S. Exporter_Toronto_Canada_7-19-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nParliament to Study Duty Deferral Program -Milk and Poultry Trade_Ottawa_Canada_8-9-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nSaborUSA Increases the Popularity of U.S. Food in Colombia_Bogota_Colombia_7-29-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Ottawa_Canada_8-4-2016.txt\nRetail Market Update_Sofia_Bulgaria_7-14-2016.txt\nRetail Food Sector Report_Prague_Slovakia_8-2-2016.txt\nStrong Results at Vinexpo Hong Kong 2016 for U.S. Wines_Hong Kong_Hong Kong_7-20-2016.txt\n","title":"The WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt","summary":"Japanese Retail Giant AEON Capitalizes on American Fairs; ATO Japan Brings Japanese Importers to\nShow; American Hardwood Seminars Attract Record Crowds in Fuchu and Sapporo; FAS Japan Hosts\nbeen collaborating with Aeon since 2009 to promote U.S. food and agricultural products, providing fresh ideas\npromote U.S. foods and introduce a wide variety of new products, including: craft beer, gourmet popcorn, U.S.style barbecue, California olive oil, artisanal U.S. cheeses, and a range of bakery and confectionery recipes.\nMarketing Institute, Sunkist, California Agricultural Export Council, American Cherries, USA Poultry and Egg\n(about 30km from central Tokyo), ATO Japan Director Rachel Nelson joined the President of AEON Retail Jerry","keywords":"agricultural agriculture japanese products product production","latentTopics":"japan, japanese, u, agricultural, ato, american, aeon, seminar, california, importers"}

The New Minister of Agriculture\nreinstated the per hectare subsidies, which had been previously cancelled.\n\nAuthor Defined:\nPRODUCTION\nFAS/Astana forecasts Kazakhstan’s wheat production in MY 2016/17 at 13.0 MMT, same as the\nprevious estimate. MY 2016/17 production is down significantly from the record 22.7 MMT in 2011.\nWhile weather was favorable during the 2016 planting, the crop is still in its early growth stages. The\nlevel of rains in August will ultimately determine the size of production.\nFAS/Astana forecasts barley production at 2.7 MMT in MY 2016/2017, only slightly higher than in MY\n2015/16 (2.6 MMT). This increase is based on projected higher sown and harvested area.\nFavorable conditions (sufficient soil moisture, good weather with minimal rains and timely preparations)\nduring the 2016 sowing resulted in a larger sown crop than in 2015. Traditionally the largest planted\nareas for spring grain crops are in the Akmola region (4.2 million hectares), the Kostanay region (4.1\nmillion hectares) and the North-Kazakhstan region (3.2 million hectares). The total planned area for\nspring grain crops was declared by the Kazakhstani Ministry of Agriculture as 14.4 million hectares;\nhowever actual planted area was 14.5 million hectares.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture reported in its Final Sowing Report, that as of June 15, 2016 spring sowing\nworks totaled 14,496 thousand hectares for spring grain crops and 1,922 thousand hectares for oilseeds\ncrops.

Total planted area in\n2016 is 1.9 million hectares, which is 210,000 hectares or 10% less, than in 2015. Two factors\nsignificantly influenced farmers’ decision to decreasing the oilseed planting area: the cancellation of the\nper-hectare subsidy which was higher for oilseeds and the 2015 cabbage moth infestation which\nsignificantly increased the cost of production for oilseeds. The largest areas for oilseeds in Kazakhstan\nare the North-Kazakhstan region (469,700 hectares), the East-Kazakhstan region (377,600 hectares) and\nthe Kostanay region (270,000 hectares).

However this production estimate\ndepends on the climatic conditions during the vegetation and harvesting periods. The Ministry also\nnoted that the traditional grain export markets, Iran and other Central Asian counties, remain open and\nKazakhstan will continue to export to those countries. Additionally, Kazakhstan continues to pursue\ngrain export opportunities with China.\nThe 2016 spring climatic conditions have been favorable (please, see Table 3 below). Following a\nplentiful winter snowfall, the soil moisture content was sufficient, but not excessive, similar to 2015.\nMany farmers confirm that the spring planting weather allowed them to work on planting through the\nend of May.

This Government\ndecision affected farmer’s 2016 planting decisions. Experts have noticed that in the grain producing\nregions in Kazakhstan the area planted to oilseeds decreased, while the area planted to spring wheat has\nincreased. Previously, the exact opposite was true – area planted to oilseeds was increasing while area\nplanted to spring wheat was declining.\nCONSUMPTION\nFood, seed, and industrial (FSI) consumption for wheat is expected to remain unchanged at 4.8 MMT in\nmarketing year MY 2016/2017. Flour consumption is expected to grow in tandem with population\ngrowth.\nFeed use of wheat in MY 2016/2017, is forecast flat. Although wheat remains the most fed grain in\nKazakhstan for livestock, most of the increase in feeding in future years is expected to be in barley and\nother feed grains and grasses because of the government’s strategy to increase area to these crops.\nIn MY 2016/17, feed use of barley is forecast at 1.75 MMT based on the increasing demand for barley\nand the new feed mill projects recently launched in Kazakhstan.\n\n\u000cAs of June 1, 2016, nearly 85% of wheat is used for food consumption, 10% for seed and 5% for feed.\nPlease, see Chart 1 below. A year ago wheat consumption was nearly identical to the 2016 data,\nshowing 80% for food, 15% for seeds and 5% for feed.\nNote: Feed consumption as of June 1, 2016, for both wheat and barley, is down 30 percent. This could\npossibly be explained by the transfer of cattle to summer grazing.\nChart 1: Wheat Consumption Structure as of June 1\n\nSource: Kazakhstan Statistical Service\nBarley consumption includes 33% for food, 24% for seed and 42% for feed. The barley consumption\nstructure remains mainly unchanged, compared to June 1, 2015. However, the 2016 stocks are down\n249,000 tons compared to 2015 stocks at the same time. Please, see Chart 2 below.\nChart 2: Barley Consumption Structure as of June 1\n\n\u000cSource: Kazakhstan Statistical Service\nFlour Mill Industry Update\nDuring May 2016 wheat prices increased between 18 and 24 percent, largely because of decreasing\nstocks. As a reaction to this price increase, millers increased prices for wheat flour. The price for\npremium class wheat flour increased 15% and 1st class wheat flour increased 16%. A number of factors\nled to the increase in wheat prices: a) the US Dollar/Russian Ruble/Kazakhstani Tenge exchange rate\nfluctuations, b) decreasing supply of wheat in the market along with a decrease in mill stocks, and c)\nhigher international prices in Europe and Russia for wheat.\nSTOCKS\nThe Kazakhstan Statistical Agency reported on June 1, 2016 that the Kazakhstani grain stocks reached 5\nMMT, 33% less than in 2015 mainly due to a decline in wheat stocks, which are 2.2 MMT (or 33%) less\nthan wheat stocks on June 1, 2015 (6.5 MMT).\nBarley stocks also decreased 40% since June 1, 2015 because of decease in food, seed and feed use, on\naverage between 36 to 48%. Please, see Chart 3 below.\nChart 3: Grains, Wheat and Barley Stocks as of June 1st, MMT\n\n\u000cSource: Kazakhstan Statistics Service\nTRADE\nKazakhstani grain exports analysis show a number of regional markets developments that have affected\nthe end of the previous marketing year and the current marketing year:\n Iran and Kazakhstan signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a grain terminal project. The\nproject is to be built in 2016-2017 on the border between Turkmenistan and Iran on the IncheBurun railway station. It is projected to have a 10,000 ton storage capacity. This infrastructural\nproject will help Kazakhstan continue to export to Iran and the Persian Gulf countries.\n\n\nDuring the period February to May 2016, experts noticed a trend of declining Kazakhstani\nexports in wheat and a growth in Kazakhstani wheat flour exports by rail. However in June\n2016, the situation may change with a decline in consumption during the month of Ramadan and\na start of the harvesting season in the importing countries.\n\n\n\nStable exports to China during the last four months could be an indication of further\ndevelopment of the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nWheat flour exports to Central Asian counties continue to grow, however import duties affect\nmillers’ margins.\n\n\n\nKazakhstan’s exports to Iran dropped significantly, most notably as transshipments through the\nCaspian Sea grain terminal decreased approximately 80 percent.\n\n\n\nKazakhstan’s wheat exports to Afghanistan decreased during May-June 2016, mainly because of\nAfghanistan’s shift to wheat flour imports instead of wheat imports.\n\n\u000cBarley exporters explain the following factors, which affect Kazakhstan barley exports:\n Because Turkey’s barley production estimates are down 2 million tons, Kazakhstani exporters\nare hopeful that Kazakhstani exports to Turkey will increase.\n\n\nIran’s barley production is expected to be flat, but Iranian barley demand continues to grow.\n\n\n\nBarley exports to Iran are observed to be increasing after the grain terminal capacity extension\non the Caspian Sea.\n\nDuring the period January to May 2016, Kazakhstan exported 1.6 million tons of wheat. These exports\nwere mainly to Central Asian countries (80%) and China (11%).

Early in May 2016, the Minister\nof Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan resigned his position following a number of public protests\nover proposed land reform in Kazakhstan. Mr. Askar Myrzakhmetov was appointed as the new Minister\nof Agriculture.\nWhile both private and state land ownership are mentioned in Article 6 of the Kazakhstani Constitution,\nonly 1% of agricultural lands in Kazakhstan are privately held. Today there are 100.8 million hectares\nof agricultural land in Kazakhstan, including 1.3 million hectares which are privately held by\nKazakhstani citizens and 99.5 million hectares rented under 49-year rental agreements. This includes\n68.4 million hectares of pasture lands. Foreign citizens are only permitted to rent land in Kazakhstan.\nCurrently, 65,000 hectares of agricultural land in Kazakhstan, which includes 45,000 hectares for\nKazakh-American joint venture “KazBeef”. Total area for state land reserve makes 100.1 million\nhectares, which includes lion portion of 78.5 million hectares of unwatered pastures.\n\n\u000cThe history of agricultural land legislation is provided below in Box 1.\nBox 1: Overview of the Kazakhstan agricultural lands legislation since 1990\nSince 1990, agricultural lands could be rented to both Kazakhstani citizens and foreigners for shortterm periods – up to 3 years and long-term periods – up to 10 years.\nSince 1995, agricultural lands could be given to both Kazakhstani citizen and foreigners for rent for\nshort-term period – up to 3 years and long-term period – from 3 up to 99 years.\nSince 2001, agricultural lands could be given for rent to natural persons and legal entities of the\nRepublic of Kazakhstan: for short-term – up to 5 years, long-term – from 5 to 49 years; and for\nforeigners – up to 10 years with no power of further transfer to secondary land use.\nSince 2003, Land Code amendments allowed natural persons and legal entities of the Republic of\nKazakhstan to obtain agricultural lands for private ownership.\nSince 2003, Kazakhstani Government set the maximum size of agricultural lands within one\nadministrative region (county) or city, which could be rented by foreigners.\nSince 2011, foreigners, as well as legal entities with foreign capital of more than 50 percent, can\nrent agricultural lands for up to 10 years.\nSince January 1, 2015, agricultural lands could be given to foreigners for rent for up to 25 years\nwith the purpose to attract investments.\nSource: Zherturaly.kz\nIn order to provide rational and effective agricultural land use, in November 2015 the Kazakhstani\nGovernment proposed the following legal amendments on agricultural lands. (See Box 2 below)\nBox 2: Proposed amendments to Kazakh Land Codes\nIntroduction of a new mechanism of land auctions. Agricultural lands under state ownership can be\ntransferred to Kazakhstani natural persons and legal entities for private ownership through auction\nprocedures, when the estimated cost would be raised. If by the end of two auctions, a land plot has\nnot sold, the price at the next auction should be set downwards until the minimal level of 50% of the\ncadaster price is reached.\nThe auction should be organized with the following sequence: the local governments should identify\nagricultural land plots for auction. All costs for auctions should be covered by local governments.\nAccording to Article 24 of the Land Code, foreign individuals, foreign legal entities, as well as legal\nentities with foreign capital of more than 50 percent can only rent agricultural lands for up to\ntwenty five years. Hence, agricultural lands cannot be sold to foreign individuals or entities.\nPreferences for land purchases currently under rental agreement: provides for the interests of the\nnatural persons and legal entities of the Republic of Kazakhstan and gives them the right to\npurchase previously rented land plots prior to expiration of the rental term, with the preferential\nprice at 50% of its cadaster price, with installments of 10 years.\nThe provision also protects the rights of the shareholders, who transferred land to partnerships or\nindustrial capital cooperatives.\n\n\u000cLifting restrictions on operations with rented agricultural lands. The amendments allows for the use\nof rented agricultural land as collateral or disposition of rights within the rental term.\nSource: Zherturaly.kz\n\nCrop Subsidies\nAs was mentioned previously, FAS/Astana April 2016 Grain And Feed Report, the per hectare\nsubsidies (by specific crop) in Kazakhstan were cancelled as of January 1, 2016. This Government\ndecision affected farmer’s 2016 planting decisions. One of the new Agricultural Minister’s first\ndecisions was to reinstitute the per hectare subsidies. This decision was announced during the planting\nseason and therefore had no impact on 2016 crop decisions. Prior to 2016 area planted to oilseeds was\nincreasing, largely due to the higher per hectare subsidies for oilseeds and higher oilseeds market prices.\nIn 2016, the elimination of per hectare subsidies saw a reversal in this trend with more area planted to\nwheat. It is uncertain whether the decision to reinstate per hectare subsidies will change next year’s\nplanting decisions.\nFood Security\nDuring April 26-28, 2016 Astana hosted the 7th Ministerial Conference of The Organization of Islamic\nCooperation (OIC) on Food Security. Discussions at the conference focused on the current state of\nagricultural and food security in the Member States and the establishment of the Islamic Organization\nfor Food Security (IOFS) in Kazakhstan. The new organization will be tackling: population provisions\nin Islamic countries, achieving more affordable food, based on their climatic conditions and\ngeographical location, creating favorable transport and logistics routes to minimize the cost of food\nsupplies to OIC member-countries, and the stabilization of food prices through formation and\nmanagement of shared food funds.\nKazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, first initiated the establishment of IOFS in 2011 at the\n38th session of OIC Foreign Ministers’ Council. Two years later, at the meeting in Astana of 30 OIC\nmember states’ experts, the draft charter document was agreed upon. The IOFS HQ will be in Astana.\nIts office will provide the expertise and technical know-how to member states on the various aspects of\neffective development of agriculture, rural areas, food security and the development of biotechnology.\n\nNOTE: The National Bank of Kazakhstan exchange rate as of July 13, 2016: U.S. Dollar/338.51\nTenge.\n\n\u000cPSD\nWheat\nMarket Begin Year\nKazakhstan\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY Exports\nFeed and Residual\nFSI Consumption\nTotal Consumption\nEnding Stocks\nTotal Distribution\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nSep 2014\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nSep 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nSep 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n11923\n1988\n12996\n600\n600\n0\n15584\n5539\n5507\n2000\n4800\n6800\n3245\n15584\n\n11923\n1988\n12996\n600\n600\n0\n15584\n6600\n6600\n2000\n4800\n6800\n2184\n15584\n\n11571\n3245\n13748\n75\n75\n0\n17068\n7500\n7500\n2100\n4800\n6900\n2668\n17068\n\n11570\n2184\n13747\n22\n22\n0\n15953\n7000\n7000\n2100\n4800\n6900\n2053\n15953\n\n11000\n2668\n13000\n60\n60\n0\n15728\n7000\n7000\n2100\n4800\n6900\n1828\n15728\n\n11000\n2053\n13000\n30\n30\n0\n15083\n6700\n6700\n2100\n4800\n6900\n1483\n15083\n\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\nBarley\nMarket Begin Year\nKazakhstan\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY Exports\nFeed and Residual\nFSI Consumption\nTotal Consumption\nEnding Stocks\nTotal Distribution\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nJul 2014\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nJul 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nJul 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n1909\n282\n2412\n27\n28\n0\n2721\n483\n476\n1700\n300\n2000\n238\n2721\n\n1909\n282\n2412\n26\n28\n0\n2720\n483\n476\n1700\n300\n2000\n237\n2720\n\n2038\n238\n2675\n10\n10\n0\n2923\n815\n800\n1700\n300\n2000\n108\n2923\n\n2038\n237\n2675\n39\n39\n0\n2951\n810\n810\n1700\n300\n2000\n141\n2951\n\n2100\n108\n2700\n10\n10\n0\n2818\n700\n700\n1750\n300\n2050\n68\n2818\n\n2100\n141\n2700\n10\n10\n0\n2851\n700\n700\n1750\n300\n2050\n101\n2851\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Grain and Feed Update_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_7-15-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-21-2016.txt\nNile Nuggets for July 2016_Cairo_Egypt_7-24-2016.txt\nCrop update - France weighs heavy on otherwise positive prospects_London_United Kingdom EU-27_7-20-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-18-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-28-2016.txt\nRussian Agricultural Policy and Situation Bi-Weekly Update - 10_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-20-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Dhaka_Bangladesh_8-5-2016.txt\nRenewed Temporary Export Ban on Some Hides and Skins_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-22-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nBrazil Agricultural Economic Factsheet_Brasilia_Brazil_7-25-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_New Delhi_India_7-28-2016.txt\nMinistry of Agriculture Paves the Way for US Corn Imports_Brasilia_Brazil_8-4-2016.txt\nDraft SPS Measure to WTO_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nOilseeds Market Update_Vienna_EU-28_8-3-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\n","title":"Grain and Feed Update_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_7-15-2016.txt","summary":"areas for spring grain crops are in the Akmola region (4.2 million hectares), the Kostanay region (4.1\nspring grain crops was declared by the Kazakhstani Ministry of Agriculture as 14.4 million hectares;\nThe Kazakhstan Statistical Agency reported on June 1, 2016 that the Kazakhstani grain stocks reached 5\nChart 3: Grains, Wheat and Barley Stocks as of June 1st, MMT\nDuring the period January to May 2016, Kazakhstan exported 1.6 million tons of wheat.\nDuring the period January to May 2016, Kazakhstan exported 938,977 tons of wheat flour.\nof agricultural land in Kazakhstan, including 1.3 million hectares which are privately held by","keywords":"kazakhstan land lands wheat barley","latentTopics":"wheat, kazakhstan, exports, barley, hectares, agricultural, grain, kazakhstani, land, planting"}

Singh\nReport Highlights:\nPost’s marketing year (MY) 2016/17 (May/April) rice production is forecast marginally lower at 34.51\nmillion metric tons (MMT) on estimated lower planting (11.7 million hectares). Based on the latest\ncustoms data, MY 2015/16 rice imports are lowered to 0.22 MMT. MY 2016/17 rice imports are also\nrevised lower to 0.15 MMT on sufficient domestic supplies and uncompetitive imports due to the\ngovernment decision to raise import duty to 25 percent. Post’s MY 2016/17 (July/June) wheat import\nforecast is raised to 4.4 million tons on expectation of strong domestic demand and expected low\ninternational prices.\n\n\u000cPost:\nDhaka\n\nCommodities:\nRice, Milled\nWheat\n\nAuthor Defined:\nFor MY 2016/17 (May/April), Post’s rice production forecast is revised marginally lower to 34.51\nMMT from 11.7 million hectares on reduced planting of Aus (summer) rice and increased Boro (winter)\nrice production. Aus (summer) rice (planted in March/April and harvested in July/August) production is\nestimated lower at 2.4 MMT due to decreased acreage (1.1 million hectare) against the initial\nexpectation (1.2 million hectares) due to insufficient irrigation water at seedling and planting time and\narea shift to other competing crops. Field sources report that many farmers switched their land from\nAus rice to jute, maize and vegetable cultivation due to higher returns. The Government of\nBangladesh’s (GOB) notification for mandatory use of bulk burlap bags for five agricultural\ncommodities is driving demand for jute and farmers have responded by increasing jute cultivation,\nwhich they expect will be more profitable than Aus rice. However, Boro (winter) rice production\n(planted in December/January and harvested in May/Jun) is forecast marginally higher and is revised up\nto 18.8 MMT (planted in December/January and harvested in May/Jun) based on preliminary official\ndata of Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).\nGiven the normal progression of the 2016 monsoon, broadcasted Aman (autumn) rice planting was\ncompleted on schedule, and transplanted Aman (late autumn) rice seedling production and transplanting\ncurrently progressing well and will continue till August. For more information on rice growing seasons\n(Boro, Aman, and Aus), please see GAIN Report BG3004 or BG5003.\nOn April 24, 2016, the Ministry of Food (MOF) announced the procurement price for Boro milled and\npaddy (unmilled) at BDT 32 ($0.41) and BDT 23 ($0.29) per kilogram, which is procured during the\nperiod May 05, 2016 to August 31, 2016 with the target of 0.6 MMT for Boro rice and 0.7 MMT for\nBoro paddy.\nPost’s MY 2016/17 (July/June) wheat production forecast remains unchanged at 1.33 MMT assuming\nnormal weather conditions during the planting and crop season (planted in November/December and\nharvested in March/April). During April to June 2016, the GOB domestically procured 0.2 MMT of\nMY 2015/16 wheat at the procurement price of BDT 28 ($0.35) per kilogram.\nRice and Wheat Market Prices\nSufficient supplies have resulted in weak domestic prices of wheat and rice in the recent months. For\nJuly 2016, the wholesale and retail prices for rice in Dhaka and Gazipur were BDT 26.3 ($0.33) and\nBDT 29.3 ($0.37) per kilogram, respectively, which were 7.5 percent and 5.4 percent less than same\nmonth last year (Figure 1). However, June rice prices improved as rice millers narrowed rice supply to\nthe market and held back stocks for supplying rice to GOB Boro rice procurement program to avail\nhigher price. For the same month, the average retail price of wheat flour (also called atta) in Dhaka was\nestimated at BDT 24 ($0.3) per kilogram, which was about 17 percent below last year (Figure 2), and 18\npercent below current rice retail prices (Figure 1).\n\n\u000cFigure 1: Bangladesh- Coarse Rice Prices in Dhaka and Gazipur\n\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture, Government of Bangladesh\nFigure 2: Bangladesh- Atta (wheat flour) Prices in Dhaka\n\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture, Government of Bangladesh\nRice and Wheat Imports\n\n\u000cThe MY 2016/17 rice import forecast is lowered to 0.15 MMT on expectation of strong import\nprotection policy impact. The added 25 percent tariff on rice imports (see Policy section below) further\naffected import prospects. MY 2015/16 rice imports are revised marginally lower to 0.22 MMT based\non the latest customs data. MY 2016/17 wheat import forecast is raised to 4.4 MMT on expected strong\ndomestic demand and lower international prices. Based on the current pace of imports, Post’s MY\n2015/16 wheat import estimate is revised up to 4.2 MMT on competitive prices.\nRice and Wheat Stocks\nAccording to the MOF, the government rice stocks on July 21, 2016 came down to 556,580 tons\ncompared to 1.1 MMT same time last year. However, the government wheat stocks rose to 318,290 tons\nduring the same period.\nPolicy\nOn June 2, 2016, the GOB increased tariffs from 10 to 25 percent and removed 10 percent regulatory\nduty on rice imports in place since December, 2015. In addition, the GOB also imposed a 15-percent\nvalue added tax (VAT), an advance income tax (AIT) of five percent, and an additional advanced trade\nVAT (ATV) of four percent. The tariff was raised and other taxes are added to stop cheaper Indian rice\nimports that generally constitute the largest share of the import market.\nIn the MY 2016/17, GOB set a target of procuring 0.7 MMT and 0.6 MMT of paddy (unmilled) and\nmilled Boro rice in period May – August, 2016. In fiscal year (FY) 2015/16 (July to June), according to\nthe MOF, Bangladesh procured 1.06 MMT and 199,989 metric tons (MT) of Boro and Aman milled rice\nfrom domestic market.\nFor the first time GOB procured Boro paddy directly at BDT 23 ($0.29) per kilogram from officially\nselected farmers who have a farmer identification card and a bank account. GOB procurement of Boro\npaddy from farmers was about four percent of rice production in the Boro season, which indicates a\nlarger share of farmers did not participate in the GOB’s price support program. These farmers mostly\nsold their harvested paddy (unmilled rice) to agents and millers in open markets at lower prices BDT\n11.25 – 13.75 ($0.14-0.17) per kilogram before starting the procurement program.\nIn the budget FY 2016-17, GOB withdrew the VAT for imported wheat and rice milling equipment and\nparts. In the budget, the GOB raised custom duty of wheat starch from 10 to 15 percent. For FY\n2016/17, Bangladesh extended the export ban on non-fragrant rice. The GOB may allow\naromatic/fragrant rice exports, pending permission from the Ministry of Commerce.\n\n\u000cTable 1.

Post’s\nforecast for MY16/17 soybean imports is slightly lower than the official USDA data forecast of 87\nMMT. China’s recent sale of stored oilseed and oilseed product reserves (soybeans and rapeseed oil)\nwill absorb some of the market share for food soybeans and vegetable oils. However, forecast lower\nimports of DDGS as a result of China’s anti-dumping investigation may increase demand for soybean\nmeal and thus support growth of soybean imports.\n\nMY16/17 Chinese soybean production is forecast to recover to 12.5 MMT\nDue to recent change in the Chinese government’s corn policy (see related GAIN Report\nCH16035 Oilseeds and Products Update), domestic soybean production is forecast to recover in\nMY16/17 to12.5 MMT from the estimated 11.6 MMT in MY15/16. Post’s MY16/17 production,\nis slightly higher than the USDA June 2016 official data of 12.2 MMT. This is based on a larger\nforecast planted area of 6.9 MHa, up 7.1 percent from the previous year.\nIn late July, China’s Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced that newly added soybean area\nreached 8 million Mu (or 533,000 Ha) in MY16/17 as a result of government’s efforts and policy\nsupport to restructure the crop mix. In its July 20 report, China’s National Grain and Oilseed\nInformation Center (CNGOIC) estimated that the MY16/17 soybean planted area is up by 500,000\nHa from the previous year. The highest increase in planted area is in Heilongjiang province\nfollowed by Henan, Anhui and Shandong. The Heilongjiang province’s soybean industry leader\nestimated that the MY16/17 corn acreage in the province is down by 1 million hectares (MHa),\npart of which was substituted with soybeans. A recent report by one of the major Branches of the\nHeilongjiang State Farm Bureau showed the Branch’s 2016 soybean acreage increased by 40\npercent to 152,000 Ha from the 108,666 Ha last year. This is in response to the government’s call\nfor less corn planting and also to keep good crop rotation practices. However, recovery of the\nsoybean area remains difficult to predict for the coming years as many soybean farmers expressed\nconcern about the price and profits for the MY16/17 crop. The domestic food soybean market\ncontinues to be challenged by imported soybeans used for food processing.\nAccording to an MOA survey released during the first week of July, the growth of MY16/17\nsoybean crop in the Northeast soybean-producing region is rated as “good” due to favorable\nweather conditions.\nMY16/17 soybean imports forecast at 86 MMT\nBased on a forecast steady growth in protein meal consumption to meet the growing animal\nproduction sector, Post’s forecast for MY16/17 soybean imports is 86 MMT. This is a net\nincrease of 3 MMT from MY15/16 but lower than the USDA June 2016 official forecast of 87\nMMT. Post estimate for MY15/16 soybean imports coincides with USDA’s official June estimate\n\n\u000cof 83 MMT, up by 4.65 MMT from MY14/15. According to Global Trade Atlas data, China’s\nsoybean imports continue to be strong hitting 60.6 MMT in the first nine months of MY15/16, up\n12 percent over the previous year. CNGOIC estimated MY15/16 soybean imports at 83 MMT\nbased on contracts during the last quarter of MY15/16.\nAccording to China’s industry statistics, the current profit margins (during the 30th week/July 1622) for swine farmers remained high ranging from RMB500 ($76) to 700($106)/head but much\nlower than the RMB1,000 ($151) to 1,500 ($227)/head in May. However, China’s industry\nassociation estimated a slight fall in the 2016 pork production based on a slow recovery of the\nswine and sow inventory. Poultry production remained generally stable in July. Industry leaders\nestimate moderate growth for both poultry meat and eggs in 2016.\nMOA forecast feed production growth is expected to level off during “the 13th Five Year Plan\nPeriod” (2016-2020), with a yearly growth rate ranging from 1.5 to 2 percent or annual net growth\nof 4 to 6 MMT. The growth is mainly driven by swine (of which currently 75 percent are raised\nwith industry feed) and ruminant farming. MOA estimates soybean meal use increased rapidly to\n55 MMT in 2015, a net growth of 5.5 MMT from 2014. This is based on a small domestic supply\nof other protein meals and relatively low price for soybean meal (which is also supported by\nindustry insiders). In 2014, the net growth in soy meal use was 3 MMT.\nFactors impacting China’s soybean imports\nThe Chinese government’s decision to sell part of its 6 MMT of old soybean reserves is likely to\nimpact soybean import growth in MY15/16 and MY16/17. As of this report, two auctions were\nheld with more than 600,000 tons sold at a relatively cheap price as shown in the following table.\n\nVolume offered (1,000 tons)\nVolume purchased (1,000 tons)\nPurchase rate (%)\nAverage price (RMB/ton)\n\nJul 15\n300\n300\n100\n3,360\n\nJul 22\n579\n332\n57\n3,262\n\nJul 29\n600\n\n…….\n\nSep 30\n\nDuring the first two auctions, the majority of the buyers were food processors but more crushers\nare expected to join the auctions as the price remains low making crushing margins competitive.\nA leading industry source estimated that 3 MMT might be sold when the auction sales end at the\nSeptember. Of the total estimated sold, 2 MMT could likely be used for crushing while the rest\nfor food processing or protein extraction. The high purchase rate reflects tight supplies and\nincreasing price for food soybeans as China reportedly intensified scrutiny over imported GMOderived soybeans for food use. The low auction price remains attractive compared to the current\nmarket price of RMB4,400-4,500/ton (or $667 - 682/ton) for 2015 domestic soybeans and the\nprice for imported soybeans at RMB3,800 or $576/ton. Consequently, the U.S. soybean\ncontract/exports to China in the second half of 2016 might be impacted.\nA favorable factor supporting soybean import growth is China’s anti-dumping investigation\nagainst U.S. DDGS imports which may result in 2 to 3 MMT less of DDGS imports in 2016.\n\n\u000cChina’s DDGS imports declined significantly to about 1.5 MMT during the first 6 months of 2016\ncompared to the 2.4 MMT in the previous year. Many industry insiders estimate total DDGS\nimports could fall to 3 MMT from the record 6.3 MMT in 2015 (or average yearly imports of 5\nMMT in recent years). Lower DDGS imports in 2017 may continue and may boost China’s use\nof soybean meal.\nChina’s soybean use for food continues to grow\nBased on information from leading industry sources, Post raised its forecast for China’s soybean\nuse for food to 11.7 MMT in MY16/17, up from the estimated 11.4 MMT in MY15/16. This is\nhigher than USDA’s June data of 10.8 MMT and 10.65 MMT, respectively. China’s soybean use\nfor food (equivalent to “Food Use Domestic Consumption” in USDA PSD) includes use of\nsoybeans for processing traditional soybean food, processing food ingredients (protein) and direct\nhome use as food. China’s industry source estimated soybean use for food at 11.5 MMT in 2015,\nup about 4 percent over 2014. Out of the total soybean use, 6 MMT is used for processing\ntraditional soybean food, 2.2 MMT for processing of food ingredients, and 3.3 MMT is for direct\nhome food use. Industry statistics covering the top 50 soybean food manufacturers show total\nsoybean use in 2015 increased 4.6 percent from the previous year. Annual soybean protein\nexports stand at about 130,000 tons. Despite all efforts by the industry, estimating China’s\nsoybean use for food remains a challenge due to the numerous small players engaged in this\nsector. In general, soybean products are increasingly popular among Chines consumers which\nwill drive soybean use for food to grow steadily in the coming years.\nDomestic soybean production switched to food use\nAccording to industry sources, in “the 13th Five Year Development Plan” MOA clarified that\ndomestic soybeans are considered a “grain product.” In other words, the planting of domestic\nsoybeans is mainly aimed at meeting the domestic demands for soybean food. Accordingly, the\ngovernment has adjusted its soybean development policy to include more support to advantaged\nsoybean-producing regions and focused its soybean research/technology on protein content and\nother quality factors to improve the quality of soybean food. China’s industry leaders called for\nbrand-building for “China Food Soybeans” to raise its competitiveness in the international market.\nIndustry leaders are also concerned about unlabeled GMO soybean food will shake consumer’s\nconfidence on overall soybean food given the sensitivity to GMO-derived food among Chinese\nconsumers. In an effort to protect the share and competitive price of domestic soybeans in\ndomestic food processing market, the government is expected to continue tighter control over the\nuse of imported GMO soybeans for food processing.\n\nMY16/17 rapeseed production is expected fall\nBased on a forecast planted area of 7 MHa, down 4.1 percent from the previous year, MY16/17\nrapeseed production is forecast to fall by 5.6 percent to 13.5 MMT.\n\nMY16/17 rapeseed imports forecast at 3.9 MMT\n\n\u000cPost’s forecast for MY16/17 rapeseed imports is 3.9 MMT, unchanged from the estimate imports\nfor MY15/16, but higher than USDA official forecast of 3.8 MMT. Rapeseed imports face\nuncertainty as the Chinese regulatory authorities are likely to enforce stricter inspection rules in\nSeptember 2016. Based on a new inspection requirement, rapeseed suppliers will be requested to\nreduce foreign matter content in rapeseed exports to China to 1 percent from the current 2.5\npercent. Additionally, an expected smaller global rapeseed supply in MY16/17 may also impact\nChinese rapeseed imports. Lastly, China’s cumulative sales of state rapeseed oil reserves of 2.28\nMMT (ended in June) are expected to absorb part of the rapeseed product market share for the rest\nof 2016. That said, a significant fall in rapeseed imports is not expected given China’s large\ncrushing capacity and smaller than officially reported domestic production.\nMY16/17 Chinese peanut production to rise\nMY16/17 peanut production is expected to grow to 17 MMT given its comparatively stable profits\nand also in response to lower government support for corn planting. Based on reported acreage\nexpansion, CNGOIC’s late July report raised MY16/17 peanut production to 17.7 MMT, up 7.7\npercent over the previous year.\nForecast MY16/17 peanut imports remain strong\nPost raised its MY15/16 peanut imports to 450,000 tons primarily due to price advantages for\nimported peanuts both in shell and shelled. Comparatively, Post forecast MY16/17 imports are\ndown to 400,000 tons mainly based on expected high domestic production.\nChinese imports of both shelled and in-shell peanuts surged during the first three quarters of\nMY15/16. The imports of shelled peanuts are mainly from Senegal (about 70 percent) and the in\nshell peanuts are primarily from the United States. Industry sources reported that the import\nboom is mainly driven by price as the shelled peanuts from Senegal stood at about $840/ton while\nthe in shell peanuts from United States averaged at about $510/ton, compared to China’s price for\npeanuts/shelled for oil crushing ranging from RMB8,400 ($1,270) to 8,700 ($1,320)/ton. These\nimports remain competitive compared to domestic product even after a combined 30 percent\nimport duty and VAT (imports from Senegal are exempted from import duty). The majority of\nimported peanuts are crushed for oil. A small percentage may be used for food/snacks provided\nthe quality factors meet requirements. Peanut import shipments usually decline during July to\nSeptember as the crushers try to avoid the hot season to guarantee oil quality. Industry traders\nspeculate that higher domestic peanut prices may be indicative of a slightly lower peanut\nproduction than officially reported during the past two marketing years. It is too early to tell\nwhether the recent upward pressure on domestic prices is in fact a result of tighter supplies or an\nincrease in domestic demand. Currently, Post forecast MY16/17 imports are 400,000 tons which\ncould fall given the MY16/17 domestic peanut acreage seems to be expanded greatly coupled with\na continuing depreciation of Chinese currency, both adding pressure on import profit margins.\n\nMY16/17 cotton seed production is expected to fall to 8.3 MMT\n\n\u000cPost’s forecast MY16/17 cotton seed production is 8.3 MMT, significantly lower from the 11\nMMT in MY14/15, and lower than the estimated 8.9 MMT in MY15/16. In response to low\nprofit expectations due to the government’s low support for cotton production, Post’s forecast for\nMY16/17 cotton acreage is more than 9 percent lower than the previous year. According to a\nsurvey done in May by the China Cotton Association, MY16/17 cotton acreage is expected to fall\nby 10 percent from MY15/16.\nForecast MY16/17 vegetable oil imports level off\nBased on the high crushing volume of oilseeds and the sales of state oilseed product reserves,\nChina’s vegetable oil imports in MY15/16 declined and continue to be flat in MY16/17.\nMY16/17 soybean oil imports are forecast at 650,000 tons, unchanged from MY15/16 estimate.\nMY16/17 rapeseed oil imports are forecast at 700,000 tons, down from the estimate 800,000 tons\nfor MY15/16. Peanut oil imports are forecast at 140,000 tons in MY16/17, unchanged from\nMY15/16. Due to the relatively cheaper prices for Ukraine and Russia supplies, and Chines\nconsumer’s diversified preferences for vegetable oil, sunflower seed oil imports are up to 0.72\nMMT in MY15/16 and expected to continue high at 0.7 MMT in MY16/17.\nPost estimate of MY15/16 palm oil imports are lowered to 5.2 MMT based on lower than\nexpected imports in recent months. This is due to a combination of factors including resumption\nof export duty in exporting countries, weak demand for palm oil, an adequate supply of other\nvegetable oils, and depreciation of the Chinese currency. Palm oil imports appear to recover\nmoderately in July through September based on improved import profits and are likely to temper\nthe fall in imports in MY15/16. Post preliminary forecast of MY16/17 palm oil imports are 5.3\nMMT, up from the previous year.\nAs previously reported, since late 2015, China began to sell its aged rapeseed oil reserves,\nestimated at 6.41 MMT. Based on CNGOIC, as of June 1, 2016, a total of 2.28 MMT of rapeseed\noil reserves were sold. As of late July, the 2.28 MMT of rapeseed oil sold has been delivered\nfrom the state warehouses to refineries and will gradually enter into the end-user market during\nthe second half of 2016. The government suspended the auction of rapeseed oil in June although\nno official news were published.

Canada’s chicken tariff rate quota (TRQ) is\nprojected to reach 87,000 metric tons in 2017, from a level of 83,400 metric tons in 2016. For 2017,\nboth Canadian exports and imports of broiler meat are estimated at 150,000 MT. Imports from the\nUnited States typically account for about 85 percent of Canada’s total imports, and are thus estimated at\n127,500 MT for 2017.\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\n\nPost forecasts a return to moderate growth for 2017, with broiler meat production estimated at\n1,195,000 metric tons (MT), or 2.5 percent above the 2016 estimated level. Poultry meat will\ncontinue to be competitively priced and an attractive substitute to other pricier meats. With\nsupply management, poultry farmers in Canada recover their costs of production from\nprocessing plants. Farmers are, therefore, largely sheltered from the impact of fluctuating feed\ncosts. Although poultry processors' ability to pass on input costs to downstream customers is\nmore limited, in 2017 they are likely to continue to enjoy positive profit margins.\n\n\n\nFor 2016, Post estimates the broiler meat production at 1,165,000 MT, a level reflecting an\nimproved performance in the sector compared to previous years, as the industry steadily\nincreased production throughout the year to meet a solid demand. The growth in the chicken\nsector is estimated for 2016 at 4.8 percent, which is a remarkable level. The last time the sector\ngrew at a rate above 4 percent was back in 2001 (a 6 percent growth rate at the time).\n\n\n\nCanadian imports of chicken meat are regulated under a tariff rate quota (TRQ) which is a\nfunction of the previous year's production level. The global quota for 2017 is projected at\n87,000 MT. In 2016 the TRQ level is 83,400 MT.\n\n\n\nCanadian poultry companies have been increasingly utilizing various government administered\nimports for re-export programs. Through these programs, Canadian chicken processors import\nchicken meat duty free for use in processing, provided they re-export the associated processed\nproducts. Since 2007, imports for re-export have exceeded the TRQ volume, and therefore total\nchicken imports are more than double the TRQ volume.\n\n\n\nTwo import for re-export programs are currently used by Canadian poultry companies. The\nCanada Border Services Agency (CBSA) operates the Duties Relief Program (DRP), which\ncontinued to increase in popularity among Canadian companies. Post anticipates that in 2017\nover 95 percent of Canada's imports for re-export will be part of CBSA's program, as opposed to\nthe imports to re-export (IREP) program administered by Global Affairs Canada (GAC, formerly\nDFATD).\n\n2|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nPoultry, BROILER MEAT\n\nNOTE: \"NEW Post\" data reflects Post's assessments and are NOT official USDA data.\n2015\n2016\nCANADA\n\n2017\n\nPoultry\nBROILER\n\nUSDA\nOfficial Data\n\nNEW Post\nData\n\nUSDA\nOfficial Data\n\nNEW Post\nEstimates\n\nNEW Post\nEstimates\n\nBeginning Stocks\n\n34\n\n34\n\n45\n\n43\n\n55\n\nProduction\n\n1,110\n\n1,112\n\n1,160\n\n1,165\n\n1,195\n\nTotal Imports\n\n150\n\n150\n\n155\n\n140\n\n150\n\nTotal Supply\n\n1,294\n\n1,296\n\n1,360\n\n1,348\n\n1,400\n\nTotal Exports\nTotal Dom.

In general, with supply management,\npoultry farmers recover their cost of production from processing plants. In this way, farmers are largely\nsheltered from the impact of fluctuating feed costs. Typically, the same cannot be said about poultry\nprocessors, since their ability to pass on high input costs to downstream customers is more\nlimited. However, given the current market conditions, it is expected that processors will continue to\nenjoy positive profit margins into the coming year.\nFor 2016, Post revised broiler production upwards to 1,165,000 MT reflecting an estimated 4.8 percent\ngrowth over the previous year, as the industry steadily increased production to meet a stable and robust\ndemand. It must be said that growth rates above 4 percent, like the estimated one for 2016, have not\nbeen observed since the 2001, when the chicken sector in Canada grew by 6 percent.\n\n3|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nSource: Statistics Canada / Post *estimate ** forecast\n\nCanadian broiler production experienced a period of rapid growth during the 1990s, with an average\nannual growth rate of 5.8 percent for the entire decade. This growth reflected a strong domestic market\ndemand both from the retail and foodservice sectors and a change in consumer preferences away from\nred meat and towards a perceived healthier chicken diet.\nDuring the decade beginning in 2000, broiler production expansion slowed down, achieving a much\nmore modest average annual growth rate of 1.6 percent. This slowdown in expansion reflected a\nmatured market that seemed to have maximized its potential. However, looking at the growth rates from\nthe last couple of years, it appears that 2015 may have marked the beginning of a new phase of more\nsustained growth in the broiler sector. This expansion period is primarily fueled by a stronger chicken\ndemand, coupled with the annual increase in Canadian population and the ethnic composition of\nCanada's immigration, where many newcomers of Asian or African origin have a stronger preference\nfor chicken meat versus red meat. The stronger chicken demand is reflective of the tighter supplies of\nred meats associated with high prices, while broiler meat is competitively priced and featured in grocery\nstores, encouraging an increased consumption.\nCanada operates a supply management system in the broiler sector. Unlike in the United States, the\nindustry is not vertically integrated. Canada has a multitude of independent chicken farmers, often\noperating family businesses, supplying live birds to processing companies. Production is tightly\ncontrolled through a quota system. Production volumes are decided for every 8-week production cycle,\nwith the national volume allocated to each of the ten producing provinces, and subsequently further\nallocated to individual producers based on their share in the total production quota.\n\n4|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nIn November 2014, a new allocation agreement was reached between industry and provincial\nstakeholders that share future growth as follows: 45 percent of future growth is allocated to provinces\nbased on historical market shares, while the other 55 percent is allocated based on comparative\nadvantage factors. Provinces that experience a higher population growth rate or a higher gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth rate receive a larger share of the future growth in broiler production. Other\ncomparative advantage factors that are taken into account include: the consumer price index, the farm\ninput price index, quota utilization, further processing and the supply share.\nConsumption\nPer capita broiler meat consumption had been stagnant and slightly declining since it peaked in 2007.\nHowever, this trend reversed in 2014 and Post forecasts this new higher consumption level to continue\ninto 2017, with a per capita level of 32.8 kg, modestly up from an estimated level of 32.4 kg in 2016.\nThis recent development is a reflection of limited and pricier supplies of red meats that prompted many\nconsumers to turn toward chicken, given that it remained abundantly available and competitively priced.\n\nSource: Statistics Canada / Post *estimate ** forecast\nLooking from a long term perspective, total domestic chicken consumption in Canada has almost tripled\nin the past three decades. The increase was partly due to the country’s population growth which\nincreased almost 47 percent from 24.5 million in 1980 to about 36 million in 2016. At the same time,\nthe increase in consumption is also attributed to chicken’s increasing popularity among Canadians\nduring the period.\nOverall, Canadian preferences have shifted towards chicken primarily due to an increase in health\nawareness and the perception that chicken is leaner and therefore healthier than other meats. In parallel,\n\n5|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nthe increase in chicken consumption can also be attributed to the proliferation of fast foods focusing on\noffering a variety of chicken based meals.\nPrice has typically not been a major factor in influencing consumption since poultry prices, due to the\nsupply management system, are usually consistently higher than pork and beef cuts, which are not under\nsupply management schemes. Over the past couple of years though, and moving into 2017, red meat\nprices are likely to trend higher, making chicken a more attractive choice price-wise as well.\nIn addition, the ethnic composition of Canada's immigration, where many newcomers are of Asian or\nAfrican origin, is one that is more likely to have stronger dietary preferences for chicken rather than\nbeef or pork. Plus, Canada’s food service providers are continually introducing chicken menu items in\ncreative ways, or as an ingredient in ethnic-style food offerings, that are becoming increasingly popular.\nChicken Farmers of Canada's Strategic Plan for 2014-2018 has as an overall objective to “grow\nconsumer demand for Canadian-grown chicken”, and lists only one quantitative goal, “to have\nCanadians eat one additional chicken meal every two months”. The previous Strategic Plan for 20092013 listed as an industry objective to increase annual per capita consumption of chicken to 33 kg, an\nambitious goal that remained unachieved.\n\nPrices\nWith the supply management system, chicken producers receive a fixed price for their live birds, which\nis determined every 8-week production cycle based on production costs. Ontario is the largest chicken\nproducing province in Canada, capturing about one-third of the market, and therefore Ontario live bird\nprices are the basis for the calculation of prices in other provinces. Due to the supply management\nsystem, producer prices have remained remarkably stable over time, and only showed a more substantial\nincrease over the 2008-2013 period, due to dramatic increased in grain and feed prices. However, since\n2014, prices have come down, reflecting once again cheaper feed costs.\n\n6|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nSource: Chicken Farmers of Canada / *Post estimate\n\nThe Canadian supply management system guarantees prices only for producers and not downstream for\nthe other participants in the supply chain. Wholesale and retail broiler meat prices are usually reflective\nof market conditions in terms of supply and demand. They are also reflective of consumer preferences\nfor various chicken cuts, and of their quality and degree of transformation.\nSimilar to consumers in the United States, Canadian consumers tend to prefer white meat (breast and\nwings) rather than dark meat (legs). The most expensive chicken cut is the fresh boneless skinless\nbreast, widely used in restaurants and a preferred barbecue item for Canadians. Wings are seen as a\ngood complement to beer and are very popular during the winter hockey season. Leg quarters have\ntraditionally been the least expensive chicken cuts in groceries, cheaper even than the whole birds.\nHowever, as the ethnic mix changes in the general population, and for economic reasons, leg quarters\nare slowly becoming an increasingly popular item, as reflected by a sustained upward trend in retail\nprices over the past few years.\n\nSource: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada\n\nTrade\nImports\nFor 2017, imports are projected at 150,000 metric tons (MT), up 10,000 MT from the revised estimate\nlevel of 140,000 MT for 2016. Under the supply management system, broiler meat imports are\n7|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\ncontrolled and subject to a tariff rate quota (for more information consult the policy section of this\nreport), which is a function of the production level. Additional imports outside of the TRQ may be\nimported under re-export programs. Market conditions in the United Sates also play a significant role in\nimport decisions, since a large price differential between the lower U.S. broiler meat prices and the\nhigher Canadian ones is a strong incentive for importers to bring in more American meat, especially\nunder programs that provide a customs duty exemption, such as IREP (imports for re-export program)\nor DRP (duties relief program).\n\n8|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nCANADA: Broiler Meat Imports\nJanuary-May\n\nQuantity in metric tons, product weight\n2013\n\n2014\n\nWorld\n\n143,723\n\nUnited States\nBrazil\nThailand\nOther countries\n\n126,125\n12,210\n4,784\n604\n\n%change\n\n2015\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2016/15\n\n152,593\n\n149,833\n\n61,105\n\n49,208\n\n-19.5%\n\n135,796\n10,112\n5,831\n854\n\n127,159\n14,977\n6,133\n1,564\n\n53,686\n4,896\n2,339\n184\n\n38,301\n6,512\n2,643\n1,752\n\n-28.7%\n33.0%\n13.0%\n852.2%\n\nImport Market Shares\nUnited States\n\n88%\n\n89%\n\n85%\n\n88%\n\n78%\n\nBrazil\n8%\nThailand\n3%\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\n7%\n4%\n\n10%\n4%\n\n8%\n0%\n\n13%\n4%\n\nThe United States is Canada's largest supplier of broiler meat, with a market share typically above 85\npercent, followed by Brazil, typically at about 10 percent market share. In general, some Canadian\nimporters are discouraged from importing Brazilian chicken, despite its lower cost, because it cannot be\nre-exported to the United States. As a very recent trend, Hungary has become a supplier of frozen wings\nto Canada (possibly in the 2,000 MT range for 2016), these being reportedly priced more competitively\nthan the Brazilian wings.\nProduct Control for Brazilian Poultry: Since USDA does not permit imports of Brazilian chicken,\nthe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has strict import procedures to ensure that Brazilian\nchicken in Canada does not enter the United States. Under CFIA regulations, poultry meat imported\nfrom Brazil may not be exported to the United States and may not be used in the manufacture of meat\nproducts exported to the United States.\nCanadian poultry slaughter and processing establishments that import poultry meat from Brazil are not\neligible to export poultry meat products to the United States. In addition, poultry meat and meat\nproducts from non-eligible establishments must not enter Canadian establishments that have full export\nstatus for the United States. All Canadian establishments (including storage facilities) must maintain\ninventory records regarding origin of all meat present on their premises and the destination of meat\nshipped from the premises.\nExports\nPost forecasts 2017 broiler meat exports at 150,000 MT, up 10,000 MT from the estimated level for\n2016. While market forces play a certain role in Canada’s export levels, the main reason for the recent\nincreases in volume probably has to do with the increased use of the Duties Relief Program (DRP),\nunder which importers have up to four years to re-export the imported chicken meat, as opposed to three\nmonths under the traditional IREP. The use of the DRP became popular in 2012, and 2016 is the first\n\n9|Page\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nyear when some of the imports from 2012 are due for re-export. This explains, at least in part, the\nanticipated increases in Canada’s exports of broiler meat for 2016 and 2017.\nGenerally speaking exports fall into two broad categories: the majority of them represent the \"re-export\"\nside of the IREP or DRP, exports being a requirement of the program since the original imports are\nprohibited from entering the domestic market, while the rest of them reflect \"genuine\" exports. The\nlatter category is made up mostly of dark meat cuts (such as leg quarters) since, like in the United\nStates, the Canadian domestic market shows a stronger preference for white meat (breast).\n\nCANADA: Broiler Meat Exports\nJanuary-May\n\nQuantity in metric tons, product weight\nWorld\nUnited States\nTaiwan\nCuba\nPhilippines\nHong Kong\nTajikistan\nGabon\nOther countries\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n150,119\n61,529\n23,827\n6,299\n21,282\n6,221\n3,455\n4,615\n22,891\n\n%change\n\n2015\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2016/15\n\n136,746\n\n133,237\n\n54,615\n\n58,015\n\n6.2%\n\n60,299\n24,234\n4,449\n15,151\n7,157\n1,606\n3,758\n20,092\n\n69,253\n13,992\n10,589\n10,364\n4,207\n3,399\n2,974\n18,459\n\n27,602\n8,480\n3,923\n2,382\n1,892\n669\n967\n8,700\n\n30,381\n6,979\n797\n8,452\n3,051\n864\n156\n7,335\n\n10.1%\n-17.7%\n-79.7%\n254.8%\n61.3%\n29.1%\n-83.9%\n-15.7%\n\n44%\n18%\n3%\n11%\n5%\n1%\n3%\n\n52%\n11%\n8%\n8%\n3%\n3%\n2%\n\n51%\n16%\n7%\n4%\n3%\n1%\n2%\n\n52%\n12%\n1%\n15%\n5%\n1%\n0%\n\nExport Market Shares\nUnited States\n41%\nTaiwan\n16%\nCuba\n4%\nPhilippines\n14%\nHong Kong\n4%\nTajikistan\n2%\nGabon\n3%\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\nPolicy:\nTariff Rate Quota\nCanada controls imports of chicken under a tariff rate quota (TRQ).

For 2017, the global permit\nallowance is forecast to increase to 87,000 MT based upon the estimated 2016 production. For 2016,\nthe global chicken TRQ is 83,400 MT as based on the 2015 production level. Actual chicken imports\nunder the TRQ may be slightly higher or lower than the allocated amounts, based on prevailing market\nconditions in each year.\n\n10 | P a g e\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nUnder the TRQ, imports are subject to low \"within access commitment\" rates of duty up to the\npredetermined limit, while imports over this limit are subject to higher, prohibitive \"over access\ncommitment\" rates of duty. Imports from the United States benefit from a duty free treatment under the\nchicken TRQ, while over-quota duties can reach 250 percent.\nCanada regularly issues supplementary import permits for: 1) periods when there are product shortages;\n2) the chicken Import to Re-Export Program (IREP), under which import allocations are issued to\nCanadian poultry processors whose finished manufactured products are intended for re-export, and 3) to\nCanadian poultry companies, commonly referred to as the FTA (free trade agreement) sector, who\ncompete in the Canadian marketplace with similar, imported processed products that receive zero-tariff\ntreatment under the NAFTA. Information on the chicken TRQ, other supplementary imports and the\nprocess of importing broiler meat into Canada is located on the web site of Global Affairs Canada\n(GAC, formerly DFATD), at the following link.\n\nSource: GAC/DFATD, CBSA, Statistics Canada, Post calculations / Post *estimate **forecast\n\nImports for Re-Export Program: Traditionally, the majority of supplementary imports have been\ncomprised of imports under the IREP program. The program requires that the resulting processed\nchicken product be exported, since diversion of product imported under IREP to the Canadian\n(domestic) market is prohibited. It is a policy that helps Canadian poultry processors remain viable by\ngiving them access to lower priced imported chicken, but offers little to Canadian consumers who pay\nhigh retail prices for chicken under the supply managed regime. Canadian proponents of the IREP\nprogram argue that it allows Canadian chicken processing plants to achieve economies of scale they\ncould not otherwise achieve if restricted to available supplies of domestically produced chicken. IREP\nimports became popular at the end of the 1990s and have continued to grow significantly, to the point\nwhere in 2008 they exceeded for the first time the import volumes under the global TRQ. IREP imports\n\n11 | P a g e\n\n\u000cPoultry Report Annual – Canada – August 2016\n\nmay be sourced in any country, but in practice almost the entire volumes are imported into Canada from\nthe United States, and once processed they return back to the U.S. market.\nDuties Relief Program: The year 2012 marked the emergence of usage in another imports for re-export\nprogram, namely the Duties Relief Program (DRP) operated by the Canada Border Services Agency\n(CBSA). Post anticipates that by 2017 nearly 95 percent of Canada's imports for re-export will be part\nof CBSA's DRP program, as opposed to the IREP program under Global Affairs Canada (GAC,\nformerly DFATD). Details about the program can be found following this link. While in general the\nDRP is very similar to the IREP, there are some differences that make the DRP more appealing to\nimporters, like for instance the requirement to re-export the chicken meat within up to four years, rather\nthan within three months as required by the IREP.\n\nSpecial Agricultural Safeguard (WTO)\nIn 2008, Canada gave notice of the volume and price triggers that will be used to operationalize the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) Special Agricultural Safeguard (SSG) for Canada’s supply-managed\nproducts (i.e. products under a tariff rate quota). The Special Agricultural Safeguard is a provision that\nallows additional duties to be triggered when import prices fall below a certain price level or exceed a\ncertain volume level. Currently published volume triggers are available at the following link. Price\ntriggers are also to be listed on the same website. Unit prices which would theoretically trigger the SSG\nare currently much lower than current import price trends and activation of the safeguard is not\nexpected. In the event that import prices do decline to levels below trigger prices, the SSG would not\nautomatically be activated, but the situation would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis requiring formal\nWTO notification and an Order in Council (i.e. federal cabinet approval).\n\n12 | P a g e\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Poultry and Products Annual_Ottawa_Canada_8-4-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nFAS Canada Assists Small U.S. Exporter_Toronto_Canada_7-19-2016.txt\nParliament to Study Duty Deferral Program -Milk and Poultry Trade_Ottawa_Canada_8-9-2016.txt\nBrazil Agricultural Economic Factsheet_Brasilia_Brazil_7-25-2016.txt\nStrong Results at Vinexpo Hong Kong 2016 for U.S. Wines_Hong Kong_Hong Kong_7-20-2016.txt\nMinistry of Agriculture Paves the Way for US Corn Imports_Brasilia_Brazil_8-4-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nPork - 2016_New Delhi_India_7-21-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-28-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\n","title":"Poultry and Products Annual_Ottawa_Canada_8-4-2016.txt","summary":"Broiler meat production is forecast to expand 2.5 percent in 2017, as chicken continues to be\nboth Canadian exports and imports of broiler meat are estimated at 150,000 MT.\nCanadian imports of chicken meat are regulated under a tariff rate quota (TRQ) which is a\nFor 2017, Post forecasts a 2.5 percent increase in broiler meat production, up to 1,195,000 metric tons\nThe United States is Canada's largest supplier of broiler meat, with a market share typically above 85\nCanada controls imports of chicken under a tariff rate quota (TRQ).\nimporters, like for instance the requirement to re-export the chicken meat within up to four years, rather","keywords":"chicken priced prices price imports import imported importers importing canadian canadians","latentTopics":"canada, meat, chicken, canadian, poultry, imports, broiler, market, program, states"}

In the government’s latest attempt to provide\nrelief to the pork and poultry producers, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply\n(MAPA) has will ask the National Biosafety Technical Commission (CTNBio) to allow imports of\ngenetically modified corn from the United States.\n\n\u000cThe second “safrinha” crop is looking worse and worse as the harvest continues and there are fears that\nBrazil will run out of corn by 2017. Brazil has already imported over 500,000mt since January, mainly\nfrom Argentina and Paraguay. The high price of domestic corn is putting a lot pressure on pork and\npoultry producers, which is impeding exports and driving prices up for consumers.

From FY 2009-10 to 201415, pork production increased at a slow pace with annual growth rate of 1.4 percent. India’s pork import\nwas 527 metric tons in 2015, which increased at an annual growth rate of 11 percent from 2010 to 2015.\nThe demand for imported pork is mainly in hotel, restaurant and institutional and high-end retail sector.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nProduction:\nPork production in India is estimated at 464 thousand metric tons in FY 2014-15 (April-March) (GOI),\nwhich contributes approximately 8 percent of the country’s animal protein sources. From FY 2009-10 to\n2014-15, pork production increased at a slow pace with compound annual growth rate of 1.4 percent due\nto population growth. According to the Livestock Census, 2012, published by Government of India\n(GOI), the pig population declined by 7.5 percent to 10.3 million from 2007 to 2012. The decline in\npopulation may be attributed to disease outbreaks. The eastern and north eastern regions of the country\ncomprise around 63 percent of the pig population. The highest pig population is in state of Assam (1.63\nmillion) followed by Uttar Pradesh (1.33 million), Jharkhand (0.96 million), Bihar (0.65 million) and\nWest Bengal (0.65 million). The pork production is concentrated mainly in the states of Uttar Pradesh\n(30 percent), followed by north-eastern states (25 percent), (Bihar (15 percent), West Bengal (6 percent),\nKarnataka (4 percent), Jharkhand (4 percent), and Kerala (3 percent) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: India: Major Pork Production States\n\n* North-eastern states include smaller hilly states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,\nNagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura.\n\nThe majority of the pig population in India is of indigenous breeds (76 percent) though population of\ncross-bred and exotic pigs increased by 12.7 percent from year 2003 to 2012. The exotic breed mainly\ncomprises Hampshire, Large White York Shire, Duroc, Landrace, and Tamworth while some of the\npopular indigenous pig breeds include Ghungroo, Niang Megha, Ankamali, Agonda Goan, and TanyVo.\nThe indigenous breed animals are small sized, slow growing, produce small number of litters and have\n\n\u000clow quality pork. India’s average meat yield of indigenous breeds is around 35 Kg/animal, which is\nquite low in comparison to world average of around 78 Kg/animal. The major challenges that affect the\ngrowth of pork sector include lack of sufficient breeder farms, deficiency of feed and fodder resources,\ndiseases like classical swine fever, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and porcine\nrotavirus, limited availability of vaccines, and insufficient slaughter and processing facilities across the\ncountry. The sector is also constrained as most of the pig farmers belong to the lower socio-economic\nstrata and undertake pig farming as a livelihood rather than scientific pig farming with improved\nfoundation stock, proper housing, feeding and management. Generally, pigs are fed concentrated feed\nwith other locally available agro byproducts, tuber crops like sweet potato, tapioca, colocasia,\nvegetables and kitchen waste.\nThe industry sources indicated that India imported exotic pigs such as Duroc, Berkshires, Hampshire,\nLandrace, Large White Yorkshire, Saddleback, and Tamworth to augment the piggery production and\novercome poor performance of indigenous pig germplasm. India’s research institutes also over a period\nof time developed different crossbred animals by crossing local pigs with exotic breeds to produce\nanimals of significantly higher productivity and better characteristics. Government of India’s\nDepartment of Animal Husbandry, Dairying, and Fisheries (DAHDF) supports state governments under\nits national level programs on piggery development, establishment of pig rearing and breeding units,\nand control programs for diseases such as classical swine fever.\nConsumption:\nThe per capita pork consumption in India is negligible with the consumption mainly concentrated in\nnorth-eastern states including Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,\nSikkim, and Tripura. Other Indian states with high pork consumption include Bihar, Jharkhand, West\nBengal, Goa and Kerala. India’s Muslim population comprising 14.2 percent of the total population do\nnot eat pork due to religious reasons. Besides, large sections of Indians consumers are suspicious about\ncleanliness of domestic pork meat as pigs are natural scavenger; the factors further limiting the growth\nof pork meat sector.\nIn fact, India’s pork consumption can be divided into two segments. First segment being the\nconsumption in the form of fresh pork meat sold through unorganized wet markets and meat vendors.\nThe second segment is the high value imported pork products like sausages, ham, bacon, salami, canned\nmeat products and frozen meat. The hotels and restaurants are the major buyers of the imported pork\nproducts, which cater to international travelers and wealthier Indian consumers. There is also retail\ndemand for imported pork products amongst the well-traveled Indian consumers and foreigners residing\nin India. Though imported pork cuts are preferred for its quality, these are three to four times more\nexpensive than the domestically produced pork cuts. The distribution of imported frozen pork products\nand other meat products is a major challenge due to insufficient cold chain infrastructure across the\ncountry. Poultry is the most preferred meat in India which is currently experiencing a strong growth.\nThe processed pork segment is still very small but growing at a rapid pace due to socio-economic and\ndemographic changes. The major market for processed pork is limited to large Indian cities such as\nDelhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Pune. A large segment of the processed pork demand is in high\nend hotels and restaurants which serve pork products such as ham, bacon, and sausages for the breakfast\nbuffet and other meals. The expanding popularity of Italian and Chinese cuisines amongst high end\n\n\u000cconsumer segment also drives the demand for pork products. The domestic processed pork segment is\ncatered by few organized players selling products such as ham, bacon, salami, sausages and frozen meat.\nMost of these processors do not have any integrated value chain but procure pigs through informal\ncontracts with pig farmers.\nTrade:\nFrom year 2010 to 2015 pork imports increased at a CAGR of 11 percent on steady demand in hotel,\nrestaurant and institutional sector as well in high-end retail segment. In 2015, pork imports increased by\n28 percent from the previous year to 527 metric tons. Major suppliers of pork meat to India are\nBelgium, Sri Lanka, Spain, Italy, and Netherland (Figure 2). The major imported pork products include\npork belly, chops, loin, tenderloin, neck, shoulder, spare ribs, bacon, ham, salami and sausages. U.S.\npork exports to India are effectively prohibited due to India’s restrictive sanitary import protocol. Indian\napplies 30 percent basic tariff on imports of pork and pork products. Indian exports of pork and pork\nproducts are negligible.\nFigure 2: India: Major Suppliers of Pork and Pork Products\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\nPolicy:\nThe Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying, and Fisheries (DAHDF) regulates pork and pork\nproduct exports to India. In order to import product, the required documentation includes a sanitary\nimport permit issued by DAHDF, and a veterinary certificate certified by an exporting country’s\ncompetent authority. Indian import certification requirements and documentation for pork and\nprocessed pork products are available on DAHDF’s website (http://dahd.nic.in/dahd/default.aspx ).\nIndia’s sanitary requirements restrict US pork exports to India. The Government of India’s Food Safety\nand Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulates domestic pork slaughter and processing sector.\nFSSAI also regulates imported pork products and tests pork and pork product shipments.\n\n\u000cTable 1: Import duty and Import policy on swine meat and its various products\nHS\ncode\n\nCV\nD\n\nSpeci\nal\nCVD\n\nTotal\nduty\nwith 3%\neducatio\nn cess\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\n30.90\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\n30.90\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\n30.90\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\nOTHER EDIBEL OFFALS OF SWINE FROZEN\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\nPIG FAT, FREE, OF LEAN MEAT AND\nPOULTRY FAT, NOT RENDERED OR\nOTHERWISE EXTRACTED, FRESH,\nCHILLED, FROZEN, SALTED, IN BRINE,\nDRIED, OR SMOKED\nMEAT/EDBL MEAT OFL,SLTED,IN\nBRINE,DRIED/ SMOKD;EDBL\nFLOURS\u0026MEALS OF MEAT/MEAT OFFAL\nHAM SHOULDER CUT THREOF WTH BONE\nIN OF SWINE\nBELLIES(STREAKY)\u0026CUTS THEREOF OF\nSWINE\nOTHR MEAT OF SWINE,SLTD,IN\nBRINE,DRD/SMKD\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\n30\n\n0\n\n4\n\n36.136\n\nDescription\n\nChap 2\n\nMEAT AND EDIBLE MEAT OFFAL.\n\n203\n\nMEAT OF SWINE,FRESH,CHILLED OR\nFROZEN\nFRESH OR CHILLED\nCARCASSES AND HALF CARCASSES\n\n203100\n0\n203120\n0\n203190\n0\n203210\n0\n203220\n0\n203290\n0\n206\n\n206300\n0\n206410\n0\n206490\n0\n209000\n0\n\n210\n\n210110\n0\n210120\n0\n210190\n0\n\nHAMS,SHLDR \u0026 CUT OF SWINE, WITH\nBONE IN\nOTHER MEAT OF SWINE\n\nBasi\nc\nDut\ny\n\nImpo\nrt\nPolicy\n\nFr\nSanP\nFr\nSanP\nFr\nSanP\n\nFROZEN\nCARCASSES AND HALF CARCASSES\nHAMS,SHLDR \u0026 CUT OF SWINE, WITH\nBONE IN\nOTHER MEAT OF SWINE\nEDBL OFFAL OF BOVINE\nANMLS,SWINE,SHEEP,\nGOAT,HORSE,ASS,MULE/HINNI,FRSH,CHL\nD/FRZN\nEDIBLE OFFAL OF SWINE FRESH OR\nCHILLED\nLIVERS OF SWINE FROZEN\n\nFr\nSanP\nFr\nSanP\n\nR\nSanP\nFr\nSanP\nFr\nSanP\nProh\nSan P\n\nFr San\nP\nFr San\nP\nFr San\nP\n\n\u000cSource: Directorate General of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Pork - 2016_New Delhi_India_7-21-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Ottawa_Canada_8-4-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nMinistry of Agriculture Paves the Way for US Corn Imports_Brasilia_Brazil_8-4-2016.txt\nParliament to Study Duty Deferral Program -Milk and Poultry Trade_Ottawa_Canada_8-9-2016.txt\nFAS Canada Assists Small U.S. Exporter_Toronto_Canada_7-19-2016.txt\nMonsoon Update - Second Half Forecast Calls for More Rain_New Delhi_India_8-5-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nCotton and Products Update - July 2016_New Delhi_India_8-3-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nWTO Notified Import Requirements for Poultry and Poultry Products _New Delhi_India_8-8-2016.txt\nBrazil Agricultural Economic Factsheet_Brasilia_Brazil_7-25-2016.txt\nIndian Government Rolls Out Single Window Import Clearances_New Delhi_India_8-1-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_New Delhi_India_7-28-2016.txt\n","title":"Pork - 2016_New Delhi_India_7-21-2016.txt","summary":"From FY 2009-10 to 201415, pork production increased at a slow pace with annual growth rate of 1.4 percent.\nThe demand for imported pork is mainly in hotel, restaurant and institutional and high-end retail sector.\n2014-15, pork production increased at a slow pace with compound annual growth rate of 1.4 percent due\nFigure 1: India: Major Pork Production States\nOther Indian states with high pork consumption include Bihar, Jharkhand, West\nThe second segment is the high value imported pork products like sausages, ham, bacon, salami, canned\ndemand for imported pork products amongst the well-traveled Indian consumers and foreigners residing","keywords":"pork meat pig pigs","latentTopics":"pork, india, meat, percent, swine, fr, pig, indian, imported, growth"}

Soybean area remains stable while\nrapeseed area has shrunk. Higher volumes of production would favor exports of oilseeds and products\nof processing thereof out of Ukraine. Growth of palm oil imports could reinforce this trend by\nsubstituting demand for sunflowerseed and soybean oils for domestic food consumption.\n\n\u000cGAIN Report – UP1615 – Oilseeds and Products Annual Report\n\nPage 2 of 17\n\nProduction:\nThe State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU) has released its report regarding production areas\nunder major oilseeds. In accordance to SSSU:\n\n\nsunflowerseed production area has been increased up to 5.9 million hectares (mln ha),\nwhich is closer to estimates made by representatives of the oilseed industry. This number\nis higher compared to the figure published in the initial planting report by the Ministry of\nAgricultural Policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPFU), which was used as the baseline in\nour previous annual GAIN Report UP1607;\n\n\n\nsoybean production area stays at the level of 1.8 mln ha in line with the initial assessment\nby MAPFU;\n\n\n\nrapeseed production area has been decreased down to 456 thousand ha, below the initial\nassessment by MAPFU. This adjustment could be attributed to accommodation high\nwinterkill rates.\n\nUkraine has already started harvesting rapeseed. According to the MAPFU report, farmers have\nalready harvested 384 thousand ha of this crop, producing around 1 million metric tons (MMT)\nof rapeseed as of July 28, 2016. The average yield in 2016 is 2.63 metric tons (MT) per ha, which\nis almost 4 percent higher against 2015.\nAnalysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as well as local reports suggests\npredominantly favorable weather conditions. FAS Kyiv Post has slightly increased projected\nyield estimates for sunflowerseed and soybeans. This increase has been made under the\nassumption that Ukraine would not experience prolonged heat waves during August that could\nquickly deplete the soil moisture.\n\nConsumption:\nSoybean feed consumption has been decreased for MY2015/16 with subsequent stabilization for\nMY2016/17. This adjustment has been made based on 3-4 percent decrease of animal numbers\nfor January-July 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 reported by SSSU.\nBoth soybean meal and sunflower meal consumption has been decreased for MY2015/16 with\nsubsequent stabilization for MY2016/17. This adjustment has been made based on 10 percent\ndecrease of poultry numbers in industrial enterprises, which are the main consumers of such feed\ningredients, for January-July 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 reported by SSSU.\nFood use for sunflower and soybean oils decreased for MY2015/16 with subsequent stabilization\nfor MY2016/17. This adjustment resulted from the hike of imports of palm oil to Ukraine for\nMY2015/16 (please see the Trade Section for more details).\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUSDA Foreign Agricultural Service\n\n\u000cGAIN Report – UP1615 – Oilseeds and Products Annual Report\n\nPage 3 of 17\n\nTrade:\nAccording to the latest trade figures Ukraine has already imported 74.4 thousand MT of palm oil\nin January-May 2016 -- 85.6 percent higher compared to the same period of 2015. This might be\nthe beginning of the trend for the next couple of years. The rise of palm oil consumption as well\nas subsequent imports could be stemming from the food industry’s interest to keep production\ncosts down. Ukraine is currently experience shrinking incomes of domestic consumers. For more\ninformation about the general economic situation in Ukraine please refer to our GAIN Report\nUP1607.\nThis surge of imports of palm oil translated into higher import estimates for MY2015/16 and\nMY2016/17, as well as decreased food use for sunflower and soybean oils, which are more\nexpensive substitutes for the food industry.\nExport volumes of sunflowerseed, rapeseed, soybeans and products of processing thereof for\nMY2015/16 have been slightly adjusted based on the latest export figures available at the end of\nthis report.\nProduction, Supply and Demand Data Statistics:\nProduction of rapeseed for MY2015/16 reflected in PSD tables has been increased up to 1810\nthousand MT versus 1737 thousand MT officially reported by the SSSU. This adjustment has\nbeen made to accommodate the official rapeseed oil production figures as well as exported\nvolumes of rapeseed for MY2015/16.\nSunflowerseed\nOilseed, Sunflowerseed\nMarket Begin Year\nUkraine\n\nArea Planted\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nMY Imp. from U.S.\nMY Imp. from EU\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nMY Exp. to EU\nCrush\nFood Use Dom.

There are sufficient production capacities and feedstock available to meet those\ntargets. However, a recent increase in the excise tax might challenge meeting those goals in 2017.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nI. Executive Summary\nThe long term goals of the Czech energy strategy as defined in the State Energy Conception of the\nCzech Republic 2015 are: safety, competitiveness and sustainability. The Czech biofuel policy reflects\nthat, being also significantly influenced by the European Union policy and regulations. Major energy\nsources and percent share of total Czech electricity generation based on installed capacities in 2014 are:\ncoal – 50 percent, nuclear – 20 percent, hydropower – 10 percent, solar – 9 percent, natural gas – 6\npercent, biogas – 4 percent, wind – 1 percent.\nThe target set by the European Commission under Directive 2009/28/EC is to reach 13 percent share of\nenergy from renewable sources against gross final energy consumption and a 10 percent share of\nrenewable energy sources in transport by 2020. The Czech Republic in general does not have\nsignificant problems in meeting its targets, although in 2010 they did not fulfil the target to replace 5.75\npercent of energy content of fossil fuels consumed in transportation with biofuels. Blending of biofuels\nwith fossil fuels has been mandatory in the Czech Republic since September 1, 2007. Recent changes in\nexcise tax legislation might challenge fulfilling the targets in 2017, as they temporarily increase prices\nof biofuels and make them less competitive.\nThe Czech Republic has sufficient capacities for biofuel production but they are currently underused.\nFeedstock for biofuel production is mostly local. Czech producers use locally grown rapeseed for\nbiodiesel and sugar beet and grains as a feedstock for ethanol production. There is exportable surplus of\nfeedstock available.\nII. Policy and Programs\nBeing an EU member, Czech Republic creates biofuels policy in connection with that of the European\nUnion (EU). The regulatory framework for the EU biofuels and biomass market consists of the EU\nEnergy and Climate Change Package (CCP) and the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD). In the Renewable\nEnergy Directive (RED), which is part of the CCP, specific sustainability requirements are laid out for\nliquid biofuels. These include minimum greenhouse gas emissions reductions, land use and\nenvironmental criteria as well as economic and social criteria.\nFor more details on the EU biofuels policy, situation and market please refer to the EU-28 Biofuels\nAnnual 2016 report in our GAIN system available at http://gain.fas.usda.gov.\nThe Czech Republic transposed the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED) into Act on Air\nProtection no. 201/2012 and to Government Directive no. 351/2012. Goals stemming from that\nlegislation are:\nObligation to\nreduce GHG\nemissions by\n(%)\n\nMinimum GHG\nemissions savings in\nbiofuels\n(%)\n\nShare of biofuels and renewable\nelectricity in transportation on total\nconsumption\n(% energy content)\n\n\u000c2014 2016\n2017 2019\n2020\n\n2\n\n35\n\n5,71\n\n4\n\n50\n\n8,00\n\n6\n\n60\n\n10,00\n\nAct on Air Protection no. 201/2012 also sets mandates for individual biofuels. It is 6 percent vol. for\nbiodiesel and 4.1 percent vol. for bioethanol.\nAs a result of RED implementation, domestic production of biofuels gradually grows, as well as trade\n(mainly intra EU). In the Czech Republic local production capacity and feedstock are still not fully\nused up, therefore no significant third-country imports are foreseen, unless price driven. Many of the\nproducers use ISCC certification.\nThe Czech Republic introduced tax incentives for high percentage biofuels, as they are not price\ncompetitive on the market with fossil fuels. The situation, however, recently changed:\nThe first national Multi-year “Program of Supporting Further Utilization of Biofuels in Transportation”\nmade possible the pure biofuels and high-percentage mixtures of biofuels in transportation in the Czech\nRepublic (e.g. B30, B100, E85, E95, etc.) to be partially or fully exempted from excise taxes. The\nprogram was implemented into the Act on Excise Tax. This program expired at the end of June 2015.\nThe new, second national “Multi-year Program of Supporting Further Utilization of Biofuels in\nTransportation” for 2015 – 2020 was approved with delay. The plan includes a temporary increase in\nthe excise tax in order to compensate for the period of July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, which was\nnot covered by any approved plan but the tax exemption was still in place. The increased excise tax for\nbiofuels is now in place for the period of January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. The levels of excise taxes\nfor individual biofuels are described in the tables below.\nOriginal lower excise tax for the period of July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020\n(CZK/liter and CZK/MWh for biogas)\nFAME\nB100\nTax\n\n2,190\n\nVegetable\nOils\n1,610\n\nSMN\nB30\n8,515\n\nEthanol\nE85\n\nEthanol\nE95\n\n10,970\n\nIncreased excise tax for the period of January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017\n(CZK/liter and CZK/MWh for biogas)\nFAME\nVegetable\nSMN\nEthanol\nEthanol\nB100\nOils\nB30\nE85\nE95\nTax\n4,590\n4,590\n9,265\n10,230\n0\n\n0\n\nSMN\nHVO/\nHEFA 30\n7,665\n\nSMN HVO/\nHEFA 30\n7,665\n\nBiogas\n0\n\nBiogas\n0\n\nConsumption of fossil fuels for transportation in the Czech Republic in the last few years has picked up\nalong with the improving economic situation.

Consumption of gasoline in 2020 is projected at 1,811,000\nMT and diesel consumption at 4,286,000 MT.\nIII. Ethanol\nIn 2015, the Czech Republic produced 104,715 MT of bioethanol. The main feedstock used in its\nproduction was sugar beet (55 percent), corn (45 percent). Production capacities involve 4 ethanol\nplants that could together produce nearly 300,000 MT of bioethanol annually. In 2015, as well as in\n2014, only 2 of them were operating.\nYear\n2011\n2012\n2013\n54,412 102,195 104,488\nProduction (MT)\n89,592\n86,432\nConsumption (MT) 78,961\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Trade, www.mpo.cz\n\n2014\n104,112\n119,042\n\n2015\n104,715\n119,548\n\nE85 consumption in 2014 totaled 23,288 MT. In 2015 it dropped to 12,329 MT. Recent increase in\nbiofuel excise taxes increased price of E85 resulting in a significant drop in demand. Many distributors\ndrastically reduced their E85 stocks and stopped offering this high-percentage biofuel. A map of gas\nstations, where the E85 is available can be found at http://www.bioethanole85.cz/cerpaci-stanice-e85.\nIV. Biodiesel\nProduction capacities for biodiesel consist of 5 major plants and a few small scale ones, totaling at\nslightly over 400,000 MT per year. In 2015 only 3 of them produced biodiesel. Czech biodiesel\nproduction in 2015 reached 167,646 MT, with rapeseed the main feedstock.\nYear\n2011\n2012\n2013\n210,092 172,729 181,694\nProduction (MT)\nConsumption (MT) 245,216 242,267 228,084\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Trade, www.mpo.cz\n\n2014\n219,316\n300,413\n\n2015\n167,646\n277,268\n\nA slight decline in production and consumption in 2015 as seen in the previous table is mainly caused\nby the increase in excise taxes.\nV. Advanced Biofuels\nThere is one plant (Oleo Chemical) producing biodiesel from animal fat from a rendering plant in the\nCzech Republic. Its capacity is reported in the media at 62,000 MT per year. The production is\n\n\u000cestimated to be lower than what the full capacity would allow. It has been used for export to other\nEuropean member states so far.\nVI. Biomass for Heat and Power\nUse of biomass for renewable electricity and heat production has been increasing, with corn silage and\nagricultural waste the main feedstock. According to data published by the Czech Ministry and Trade,\ndeliveries of electric energy produced from biomass to the grid reached 1,120,003.4 MWh in 2014.\nHeat production from biomass amounted to 20,368,960.5 GJ in 2014.\nBiogas\nBiogas has good potential in the Czech Republic and the production and number of biogas stations keep\nrising. Agricultural biogas stations produce approximately 88 percent of biogas in the Czech Republic.\n\nYear\n2015\n\nNo. of\nbiogas\nplants\n507\n\nTotal capacity\nin MW\n\nElectricity\nproduction GWh\n\n358\n\n83,887\n\nFeedstock\nCorn silage, hay and straw,\nindustrial and municipal waste\n\nSource: Czech Biogas Association, www.czba.cz\nThe figures in the table above are as of December 31, 2015. Currently there are over 600 biogas\nstations, however this number includes also those that have not been through a trial run yet.\nUnder the Rural Development Program 2014-2020 it is possible to receive support for building biogas\nstations and facilities producing heat and using cogeneration.\nElectricity produced from biogas in the Czech Republic reached 2,583,362.5 MWH in 2014. Heat\nproduced from biogas reached 3,964,548.0 GJ. Data for 2015 were not yet available in time of\npreparation of this report. Increase is, however, foreseen for 2015, as well.\nWood Pellets\nWood pellets have been popular in the Czech Republic, mainly among the producers.

This is a direct consequence of a lower harvested area due to weather problems. Exports are adjusted\ndown accordingly. Barley production for 2016/17 is forecast at 3.0 MMT, 400,000 tons lower than USDA, also\nas a result of weather limitations. Corn projections for 2016/17 remain practically unchanged, except that Post\nprojects a larger harvested area but a lower average yield than USDA. Sorghum production for 2016/17 is\nforecast at 3.4 MMT, 500,000 tons lower than USDA as Post projects a smaller harvested area. Sorghum will\nface a lot of competition from other crops and the export demand is expected to remain slow. Rice production\nand harvested area for 2016/17 are expected to be slightly smaller than what USDA forecasts.\n\n\u000c\u000cPost:\nBuenos Aires\n\nAuthor Defined:\nWheat: Post projects Argentine wheat production for 2016/17 at 13.7 million metric tons (MMT), 1.3 MMT\nlower than USDA’s official number. The main reason for such a difference is Post’s lower projected harvested\narea, which is now estimated at 4.6 million hectares, 400,000 hectares lower than USDA. The unusually wet\nconditions during autumn and early winter in the main wheat production areas of the central part of the\ncountry, due to El Nino weather pattern, complicated and limited the sowing of winter crops. Parts of Entre\nRios, Santa Fe and Cordoba provinces have suffered unusually excessive rains, high moisture and very cloudy\ndays during April-July which have shut down part of the road network (many dirt roads) and have worsened the\nproblem of high water table levels in many areas. Meanwhile, the country’s key wheat area, the center and\nsouth of Buenos Aires province, has also been suffering unusually wet weather from May to date. The harvest\nof soybeans and corn in this area is very delayed due to logistical problems caused by muddy roads and wet\nfields that cannot be harvested yet. Private sources indicate that approximately 80 percent of the country’s\nwheat has been planted to date. In the northern area, the planting window is practically over, while in the\nsouthern part of Buenos Aires province producers still have time until mid-August, but it will all depend on the\nweather of the next 2-3 weeks. In this area, some farmers are starting to evaluate whether to skip planting\nwinter crops and plant directly soybeans or corn. Despite serious problems at harvest, yields of summer crops\nin most of this area have been and remain very good. Therefore, the final planted area could even suffer an\nadditional cut. For crop 2014/15 post sets harvested area at 4.6 million hectares and production at 12.7 MMT,\nboth lower than USDA, based on information provided by several private industry contacts. This difference also\nexplains the 1.3 MMT lower ending stocks that Post carries into crop 2015/16.\nExports in 2016/17 are forecast at 7.5 MMT, lower than the 9.0 MMT estimated by USDA. This is primarily\nexplained by the difference of production forecast between Post and USDA. The Brazilian market continues to\nbe seen as the priority, with local traders estimating shipments between 4-5 MMT of wheat and an additional\nvolume of wheat flour. The production of good quality wheat will be essential to supply this market. The\nbalance will be shipped to many other markets around the world. Wheat exports for 2015/16 are estimated at\n8.1 MMT, 700,000 metric tons lower than USDA. Post estimates that some 7.5 MMT of wheat will be shipped\nby the end of November 2016 (exports from December 2015-July 2016 will total approximately 6.5 MMT) and\nwheat flour for the equivalent of 600,000 MT of wheat. Local traders and the government are vigilant that the\ndomestic industry does not run short of wheat supplies. In June 2016, an Argentine flour mill imported 290 tons\nof wheat from neighboring Uruguay to analyze its quality and see the feasibility of importing larger volumes.\nArgentina’s 2015/16 season resulted in good yields but poor quality as most of the crop had low protein.\nContacts believe that there will not be significant imports of wheat.\nPost projects domestic wheat consumption for 2016/17 at 6.2 MMT, 100,000 tons lower than USDA, and for\n2015/16 at 5.8 MMT, 350,000 tons lower than the official number. The local economy is going through serious\neconomic adjustments, such as strong reduction of energy subsidies, and a continued high inflation which are\nsignificantly harming consumption. Industry contacts indicate that wheat flour mills have reduced the volume\nthey process as sales are slow. However, most economists project a rebound of the economy during 2017\nwhich would result in a stronger demand.\n\n\u000cBarley: Argentine barley production for 2016/17 is forecast at 3.0 MMT, 400,000 tons lower than USDA. The\nmain reason for such a difference is that Post now estimates a harvested area of 800,000 hectares, 100,000\nhectares lower than USDA. As for wheat, a very wet autumn and early winter in central and southern Buenos\nAires province are limiting plantings. Some contacts are doubtful that the estimated area will be fully covered,\nestimating a total area closer to 700,000 hectares at the most. In addition, the abundant volume of barley in\nthe country (in hands of traders, malting plants, and producers) and weak international demand has made\nbuyers offer growers contracts that are not very price attractive. Furthermore, now that wheat can be sold and\nexported freely, many producers prefer to reduce or completely drop barley production as it is commercially\nmore complicated to meet minimum quality standards to capture higher prices. Post estimates a total\nharvested area for 2015/16 at 1.1 million hectares with a total production of 4.8 MMT, both lower than USDA’s\nofficial number.\nDespite a smaller production volume than what’s projected by USDA, barley exports for 2016/17 remain the\nsame at 1.9 MMT, as result of a higher carry in and a lower carry out compared to USDA for the marketing\nseason. Exports for 2015/16 are expected at 2.8 MMT, 200,000 tons lower than USDA. Local traders estimate\nthat Argentina, through November 2016, will export 1.9 MMT of feed barley (1.8 MMT have already been\nshipped or compromised), and 900,000 tons of malting barley, which is the typical volume which Argentina\nships to South American countries.\nDomestic consumption of barley for the industry in 2015/16 is expected at 1.2 MMT, 100,000 tons lower than\nUSDA. The local production of malt for export to Brazil is slowing down somewhat as beer consumption in that\ncountry has weakened.\n\nCorn: The local agricultural sector continues to be very optimistic about the 2016/17 corn crop. President\nMacri’s policy changes in December 2015 have made corn returns very attractive. The new situation\nencourages farmers to incorporate corn into their farm’s crop rotation scheme, which in the past several years\nhad shifted strongly towards soybean production. Post projects planted area to increase 1.0 million hectares,\n300,000 hectares more than USDA. There are some players who estimate even a larger expansion. Despite a\nlarger area than USDA, Post projects total corn production at 34 MMT, the same as USDA. The difference is that\nPost estimates a lower average yield, at 7.55 tons per hectare. Producers are expected to use high technology\nin their crops, especially greater volumes of fertilizers which are significantly less expensive than in the past\nseveral years. The last two corn crops in Argentina have benefited from excellent wet weather which helped\nyields reach record highs. Weather forecasters are debating on whether the upcoming summer will be neutral\nor if La Nina will have any effect. La Nina in Argentina’s most productive region is usually dry. As the planting\nseason approaches (September for early corn in the corn belt), producers will define, based on weather\nforecasts, if they plant early or late corn to skip the flowering stage in hot, dry January. With normal weather,\nearly corn yields are significantly higher than late corn. However, corn planted in December has shown to be\nvery stable.\nCorn exports for 2016/17 are left unchanged at 23.0 MMT. Shipments for 2015/16 are also maintained with no\nchange at 19.0 MMT. Local traders estimate that exports during March-June 2016 totaled 7.9 MMT, July could\ntotal 2.5 MMT, following August with 3.0 MMT, September 1.7 MMT and October with 1.3 MMT. Argentina’s\nexport window begins to end in August when Brazil’s production comes in, followed by the United States and\nthen Ukraine. To date traders have declared shipments for 17.0 MMT.\n\n\u000cSorghum: Production for 2016/17 is projected at 3.4 MMT, 500,000 tons lower than USDA. Post also projects\nharvested area at 750,000 hectares, 100,000 hectares lower than USDA. Although sorghum could grow in some\nareas, it will face competition from higher planted areas for sunflower and corn. Sorghum has a lot of problems\nwith bird damage which diminish yields significantly. It also faces competition from low technology corn\n(producers plant the seed they harvested the previous year), which gives producers the ability to consume it as\nforage or harvest it for use or sell. Apart from this, sorghum prices are lately valued at 80 percent of corn. The\nfact that there is little export demand also sets a limit to area expansion.\nPost forecasts sorghum exports for 2016/17 at 900,000 tons, lower than USDA’s 1.3 MMT. This is explained\nprimarily because of a projected smaller production. Local traders indicate that there is little demand for\nexport. Shipments during March-July 2016 will total approximately 120,000 tons.\n\nRice: Production in 2016/17 is forecast at 920,000 tons (milled basis), 80,000 tons lower than USDA. This is\nprimarily due to Post projecting a lower harvested area of 208,000 hectares, 12,000 hectares lower than USDA.\nAlthough rice prices paid to farmers have increased lately as Brazil is demanding higher volumes after its\nproduction losses, local producers are quite discouraged with this crop. The El Nino weather pattern caused the\nbreaking of several water ponds which many producers are not expected to fix, especially in central-northern\nEntre Rios province. Producers in this province have other production alternatives which are more profitable,\nsuch as corn or soybeans. In Corrientes province, area is expected to remain unchanged or drop marginally as\nseveral thousand hectares which last year were not sown because of El Nino and the risk of large river flooding,\nwould come back into production. Production for 2015/16 is now estimated at 819,000 tons, lower than USDA’s\n891,000 tons. Rainy and cloudy weather have had a negative impact on average yields, which totaled 6.4 tons\nper hectare in Corrientes and 6.8 tons per hectare in Entre Rios.\nExports for 2016/17 are forecast at 550,000 tons, 50,000 tons lower than USDA. Industry contacts indicate that\nthere is a lot of rice in Argentina and that exports are relatively slow. However, exports in 2015/16 have reacted\nlately due to Brazil’s shortage. However, this situation would probably not repeat itself the following year.\n\nStatistical Tables\nWheat\nMarket Begin Year\nArgentina\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY Exports\nFeed and Residual\nFSI Consumption\nTotal Consumption\nEnding Stocks\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nDec 2014\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nMay 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nDec 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n4960\n2490\n14000\n35\n35\n0\n16525\n5301\n4200\n300\n6050\n6350\n4874\n\n4600\n2490\n12700\n35\n35\n0\n15225\n5301\n4200\n300\n6050\n6350\n3574\n\n3765\n4874\n11300\n5\n5\n0\n16179\n8800\n8600\n100\n6050\n6150\n1229\n\n3765\n3574\n11300\n30\n30\n0\n14904\n8100\n8000\n100\n5700\n5800\n1004\n\n5000\n1229\n15000\n5\n5\n0\n16234\n9000\n9000\n100\n6200\n6300\n934\n\n4600\n1004\n13700\n30\n30\n0\n14734\n7500\n7500\n100\n6100\n6200\n1034\n\n\u000cTotal Distribution\n\n16525\n\n15225\n\n16179\n\n14904\n\n16234\n\n14734\n\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\n\nBarley\nMarket Begin Year\nArgentina\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY Exports\nFeed and Residual\nFSI Consumption\nTotal Consumption\nEnding Stocks\nTotal Distribution\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nDec 2014\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nDec 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nDec 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n900\n492\n2900\n0\n0\n0\n3392\n1552\n1599\n200\n1300\n1500\n340\n3392\n\n900\n492\n2900\n0\n0\n0\n3392\n1552\n1599\n200\n1300\n1500\n340\n3392\n\n1225\n340\n4900\n0\n0\n0\n5240\n3000\n2900\n400\n1300\n1700\n540\n5240\n\n1100\n340\n4800\n0\n0\n0\n5140\n2800\n2700\n400\n1200\n1600\n740\n5140\n\n900\n540\n3400\n0\n0\n0\n3940\n1900\n2000\n200\n1300\n1500\n540\n3940\n\n800\n740\n3000\n0\n0\n0\n3740\n1900\n2000\n200\n1300\n1500\n340\n3740\n\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\n\nCorn\nMarket Begin Year\nArgentina\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY Exports\nFeed and Residual\nFSI Consumption\nTotal Consumption\nEnding Stocks\nTotal Distribution\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nMar 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nMar 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nMar 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n3500\n1408\n28700\n3\n3\n0\n30111\n18902\n18448\n6000\n3300\n9300\n1909\n30111\n\n3500\n1408\n28700\n3\n3\n0\n30111\n18902\n18448\n6000\n3300\n9300\n1909\n30111\n\n3500\n1909\n28000\n5\n5\n0\n29914\n19000\n20500\n6000\n3300\n9300\n1614\n29914\n\n3500\n1909\n28000\n5\n5\n0\n29914\n19000\n20500\n6000\n3300\n9300\n1614\n29914\n\n4200\n1614\n34000\n5\n5\n0\n35619\n23000\n23000\n6600\n3800\n10400\n2219\n35619\n\n4500\n1614\n34000\n5\n5\n0\n35619\n23000\n23000\n6600\n3800\n10400\n2219\n35619\n\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\n\nSorghum\nMarket Begin Year\nArgentina\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nMar 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nMar 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nMar 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n770\n1202\n3500\n0\n0\n0\n4702\n\n770\n1202\n3500\n0\n0\n0\n4702\n\n750\n971\n3375\n0\n0\n0\n4346\n\n750\n971\n3375\n0\n0\n0\n4346\n\n850\n846\n3900\n0\n0\n0\n4746\n\n750\n846\n3400\n0\n0\n0\n4246\n\n\u000cMY Exports\nTY Exports\nFeed and Residual\nFSI Consumption\nTotal Consumption\nEnding Stocks\nTotal Distribution\n\n931\n954\n2400\n400\n2800\n971\n4702\n\n931\n954\n2400\n400\n2800\n971\n4702\n\n700\n900\n2400\n400\n2800\n846\n4346\n\n700\n900\n2400\n400\n2800\n846\n4346\n\n1300\n1100\n2550\n400\n2950\n496\n4746\n\n900\n1000\n2550\n400\n2950\n396\n4246\n\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\n\nRice, Milled\nMarket Begin Year\nArgentina\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nMilled Production\nRough Production\nMilling Rate (.9999)\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY Exports\nConsumption and Residual\nEnding Stocks\nTotal Distribution\n(1000 HA) ,(1000 MT)\n\n2014/2015\n\n2015/2016\n\n2016/2017\n\nApr 2015\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nApr 2016\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\nApr 2017\nUSDA Official\nNew Post\n\n231\n359\n1014\n1560\n6500\n5\n7\n0\n1378\n312\n310\n480\n586\n1378\n\n231\n359\n1014\n1560\n6500\n5\n7\n0\n1378\n312\n310\n480\n586\n1378\n\n207\n586\n891\n1371\n6500\n5\n5\n0\n1482\n520\n480\n483\n479\n1482\n\n207\n586\n819\n1260\n6500\n5\n5\n0\n1410\n520\n480\n460\n430\n1410\n\n220\n479\n1001\n1540\n6500\n5\n5\n0\n1485\n600\n600\n475\n410\n1485\n\n208\n430\n920\n1415\n6500\n5\n5\n0\n1355\n550\n550\n460\n345\n1355\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Grain and Feed Update_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-18-2016.txt\nCrop update -

This regulation will affect both domestic and imported foodstuffs.\nPost estimates that at least US$ 16 Million worth of United States exports to South Africa will have to\ncomply with this regulation, based on 2015 figures.\n\n\u000cPage 2\nBackground\nOn March 20, 2013, South Africa published the Government Notice R214 under the Foodstuffs,\nCosmetics and Disinfectant Act (54/1972) which detailed the final regulations relating to the reduction\nof sodium in certain foodstuffs and related matters. Click this link to download the Regulations relating\nto the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuffs. Affected parties were granted a period of 3 years to\nensure that their products were compliant, and the regulation came into effect on June 30, 2016.\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, this regulation is one of the several regulatory interventions that\nSouth Africa has proposed over the past few years to address the risks and rising levels of lifestyle\ndiseases such high blood pressure, heart diseases and stroke. Other related regulations that post has\npublished on the GAIN database can be found on Table 1 below.\nReduction of sodium content\nTable 2 on the following page shows the list of foodstuff that will be affected by the regulation, as well\nas the effective dates for compliance to the respective maximum sodium levels per 100g of the\nrespective foodstuff. The first maximum levels of compliance came into effect on June 30, 2016, and a\nfurther reduction is expected three years later on June 30, 2019. The regulation also provides details of\nthe methodology to be applied when testing the levels of sodium content in foodstuffs.\nImplications of the regulations\nSouth African media reports have largely focused on the impact of this regulation to bread and related\nproducts. However, the regulations affect a wider range of products including some United States\nexports. Post estimates that at least US$ 16 Million worth of United States exports to South Africa will\nhave to comply with this regulation, based on 2015 figures. While South Africa faces capacity\nchallenges in ensuring compliance with most food regulations, and that the sodium reduction regulations\nfaced strong critics citing the lack of substitutes for salt and the high costs of compliance, post\nencourages United States industry and exporters to be fully aware of these maximum sodium levels that\ncame into effect on June 30, 2016. Post has also been advised that the Ministry of Health is in the\nprocess of considering further minor amendments to the regulations and these will be notified to the\nWTO TBT Committee.

The following\nproducts have good sales potential on the Bulgarian market: distilled spirits, tree nuts, peanuts, dried\nfruits, snack/cereal foods, pulses, beef, prepared food, wine, seafood products, and soft drinks/juices.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nSection I. Market Summary\nRecent political changes in Bulgaria have led to more stable relations with EU member partners. Trade\nis expected to move upwards as a result. Bulgaria is broadly recognized as an excellent gateway into the\nwider EU market for agricultural products due to its political and financial stability as well as its\ndeveloping agriculture and infrastructure.\nEU membership has had a significant impact on trade in food and agricultural products in Bulgaria.\nCertain opportunities for U.S. exporters have all but disappeared (poultry) while others have expanded\n(see report highlights). There are also market opportunities for new food products. In general, Bulgarian\nagricultural and food imports from the U.S. will increasingly resemble the profile of U.S. exports to\nother EU member states that are heavily weighted toward consumer-oriented and high-value products.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau trade data (BICO), for Calendar Year 2015, U.S. exports of\nconsumer oriented and agricultural related products categories accounted for 47% and 33% respectively,\nand for 80% of total agricultural exports to Bulgaria, compared to 34% and 20% in CY 2014. The\ncategory of intermediate products registered 13%, followed by bulk products at 7%. These statistics\nshow that demand for high-quality products has been growing and this trend is expected to continue as\nthe economy strengthens in the following years.\nPrior to CY 2015 there was a visible shift in trade and consumption trends within certain product groups\ntoward more expensive, higher-quality products, including distilled spirits, snack foods, tree nuts, beef,\nseafood, and soft drinks. The trend has slowed down a bit in 2015, but yet remained stable considering\nEurope’s economic and financial turmoil. U.S. agricultural exports to Bulgaria in several product\ncategories, such as distilled spirits, tree nuts and dried fruits, pulses, and fish products remained at high\nlevels after notable increases the past few years. U.S. exports of peanuts increased by 80% in 2015 as\ncompared to 2014. It is expected that the volume of the exports of these and other products will remain\nstable in 2016 despite the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro in the last year.\nAlthough improvement in the country’s general economic situation is projected for 2016, lower-thanaverage consumer income will continue to be a factor limiting imports of U.S. products.\nIn 2016 the business environment for trade should reflect more efficiencies as it converges further with\nEU norms. Trade practices are showing a shift from direct to indirect imports through\nwholesalers/importers within the EU which have longstanding links with U.S. suppliers. This practical\nshift reflects efficiencies sought by importers who can source small lot/partial containers quantities at a\nmore affordable price than by direct importation.\nU.S. food products’ major competition remains products from other EU member states and from the\nincreasing output of local products resulting from rising foreign direct investment in this sector.\nThe Food Processing Industry in Bulgaria\nAccording to Bulgarian Ministry of Economy’s sector analysis, the food and beverage production\n\n\u000csectors account for about 20% of total industrial production in the country. The sectors provide\nemployment to about 100,000 people (19% of all employees in manufacturing). In 2015 the Bulgarian\nfood industry was valued at about U.S. $5 billion.\nBulgaria produces meat and meat products, fish, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, bakery products\netc. About 5800 companies are operating on the market, nearly half of them located in the South Central\nand South Western regions. Companies in the sector include Nestle Bulgaria, Mondelez Bulgaria, CocaCola Hellenic Bottling Company, Bella Bulgaria, Chipita Bulgaria, Danone Bulgaria, and others. More\ndetailed information can be found in Section II, subsection C of this report.\nThe leading Bulgarian agricultural trade partners today are EU Member States, neighboring countries,\nand Russia. Over 72% of Bulgaria’s total ag trade is with other EU countries. Top EU ag trade partners\nare Greece (20.3% of total ag trade), Romania (18.8 %), Germany (8.5 %), and Spain (8.1%). The top\nag trade partners outside of the EU are Turkey, the United States, China, Macedonia, and Serbia. The ag\ntrade with the so called Commonwealth of Independent States (some of the former Soviet Republics,\nincluding Russia) decreased by 10.4% on an annual basis to U.S. $121 million in 2014. One of the main\nfactors for the decrease is the crisis in Ukraine and the ban on import of agricultural products imposed\nby Russia. (Source: Ministry of Agriculture’s Agrarian Report)\nAccording to the latest Eurostat statistics on comparative price levels of consumer goods and services\nfor food, non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco, Bulgaria is among the EU-28\ncountries with the lowest food prices in Europe. However, according to the data of the Bulgarian\nNational Statistical Institute (NSI), the average Bulgarian household spends almost 35% their income on\nfood and beverages. For comparison, the percentage in Germany is about 12%. Among the EU Member\nStates Poland is the least expensive country for food and non-alcoholic beverages, while Bulgaria is\nlowest for alcoholic beverages and tobacco. Low food prices result from high competition between\ndiscounters and the grocery retail sale segment.\n\nImports of U.S. agricultural and fish products, Bulgaria, 2015 figures\nBulk Agricultural Products, total imports\nU.S. $\nBulk Agricultural Products, imports from U.S.A.\nU.S. $\nIntermediate Agricultural Products, total imports\nU.S. $\nIntermediate Agricultural Products, imports from U.S.A.\nU.S. $\nConsumer-Oriented Agricultural Products, total imports\nU.S. $\nConsumer-Oriented Agricultural Products, imports from U.S.A.\nU.S. $\nFish and Seafood Products, total imports\nU.S. $\nFish and Seafood Products, imports from U.S.A.\nU.S. $\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\n419 million (m)\n3.4 m (0.8%)\n638 m\n2.52 m (0.4%)\n1,651 m\n13.07 m (0.8%)\n89 m\n0.5 m (0.5%)\n\nKey market drivers and consumption trends\nThe most important sectors of the food industry in 2015 were bakery and confectionery, dairy\nproduction and processing, meat products, poultry \u0026 eggs, sweets \u0026 chocolate products, fruits \u0026\n\n\u000cvegetables processing, and wine production.\nOrganic products have become more important for Bulgarian consumers. With prospects of economic\nimprovement in 2016 and 2017, and stabilization of consumer incomes, it is expected that the interest in\nconsumption of organic and health food products will be sustained and developed. For more information\nabout the Bulgarian organic products market please refer to FAS Sofia’s latest Organic Food Market\nUpdate GAIN report.\nThe latest official statistical data on food and beverage consumption in 2015 shows that it has slightly\nincreased by 0.4% compared to 2014. This has not deterred new investment since the country still has a\nmoderate number of outlets per capita when compared to other EU countries. The potential for growth\nof the modern trade, as well as for food/drinks consumption in more medium term, is substantial. Please\nrefer to FAS Sofia’s Retail Market GAIN report for more information about Bulgaria’s retail food and\nbeverage market.\nAdvantages and Challenges\nAdvantages\nIncrease in consumption of food and edible fishery\nproducts is creating demand for more imports.\n\nThe Bulgarian retail market is expanding, offering\nmore consumers access to modern retail options.\n\nGrowing food processing industry at a rate of 5-6%\nannually is looking for new imported food ingredients.\n\nThe U.S. offers a broad range of food ingredients and\nproducts, effectively capable of satisfying demand\nacross different consumer income levels. Brand\nrecognition, particularly with consumer-ready\nproducts, is a particular strength in the Bulgarian\nmarket.\nThe U.S. has a reputation as a reliable supplier of food\ninputs in terms of availability, delivery and quality.\n\nBulgarian consumer confidence in U.S. products due\nto the very well-established U.S. food safety\nregulatory system.\n\nChallenges\nStrong competition from EU exporters\nwhich are able to provide commodities in\nsmaller volumes, thus reducing pressure of\nhigh stocks on the buyers’ cash-flow.\nLower purchasing power of the average\nBulgarian and the size of the local market\nlimit U.S. exports of higher-value\nproducts.\nEU regulation and tariffs give preferential\naccess to products from EU countries. U.S.\nexporters face competition from tariff-free\nproducts from other EU countries.\nNon-tariff barriers such as phytosanitary\nrestrictions and traceability requirements\ncan make exporting to Bulgaria\ncomplicated.\n\nPreference of U.S. companies to work with\nEU distributors responsible for a certain\nregion of Europe, and to exclude local\nimporters who would like to engage in\ndirect import from United States.\nDifferences between US and EU\nproduction systems for beef, pork and\npoultry keep some products out of the EU\nmarket.\nSome products of modern biotechnology\n\n\u000cMarketing costs to increase consumer awareness are\nlow.\n\nare prohibited.\nU.S. exporters opt not to advertise\nproducts to increase awareness of their\nproducts due to perceived high costs.\n\nSource: FAS Sofia\n\nSection II. Road Map for Market Entry\nA. Entry Strategy\nU.S. companies seeking to export their goods to Bulgaria are advised to research the market. USDA’s\nForeign Agricultural Service offers USA suppliers a number of valuable services to support them with\nmarket entry. Please see the FAS Attaché Reports in the USDA Global Agricultural Information\nNetwork (GAIN) and contact FAS Sofia for clarification on specific questions. Once U.S. companies\nhave acquired this background information, they have several choices on how to enter the market. They\nmay consider attending or visiting one of Europe’s many USDA endorsed trade shows and other trade\nshows in Europe as well as some of the food trade shows in Bulgaria.

Market Structure\nThe Bulgarian food ingredient market has various supply channels, depending on the type of food\nproducts. Most of the small and medium size processors use local products, while the bigger ones buy\nfrom both local producers and from foreign suppliers. Retailers usually purchase directly from the\nprocessor or the buying organization. Many of them also work directly with foreign suppliers. The Hotel\nRestaurant and Institution (HRI) sector may purchase directly from a wholesaler whereas smaller HRI\noutlets generally purchase products from cash and carry operations.\nU.S. exporters of food ingredients usually enter the Bulgarian market through local specialized\ningredients importers, who would be engaged also in promoting the product to the customers. U.S.\nproducts that have successfully entered the Bulgarian market are known for their higher quality, but\nsince some of them are positioned in the high-end segment, the competition from local and products\nfrom other EU countries on the price driven Bulgarian market is very strong.\n\nSupply Chain Chart\n\n\u000cIn 2015 the foodservice channel accounts for 19% average market share in volume in sales of eight\nmajor food categories: alcohol; confectionery/sweets; salty snacks; coffee; cocoa drinks; soft drinks,\nbottled water, while the market share in value reaches 30%. See more market data about growth of sales\nof packaged food by category (in volume and value), company brand shares – global brand owner\n(GBO) and national brand owner (NBO), and forecast sales of packaged food by category (in volume\nand value) in Exhibit I at the end of this report.\nOver the last two years consumption of alcohol, beer and soft drinks kept moving more towards home\nconsumption while that of coffee from home to foodservice consumption. There is also a strong\ntradition of home production of food in Bulgarian households, which still strongly affects multiple\ncategories such as pickled products, chilled meat and fish, canned fruits and vegetables, nuts and fruits\nsnacks. Bulgarians still consider homemade food healthier and of better quality than processed food.\nHowever, the in-home production tradition is fading among younger generations who value the\nconvenience and trust the quality of packaged food offered by grocery retailers. Young people are\nfollowing the trend for healthy food and are more careful about the products they buy.\nThe changes in consumer habits represent serious challenges to foodservice suppliers and in Bulgaria.\nCompanies are looking for winning concepts, such as low and affordable prices, good service, and/or\norganic products. Suppliers and retailers are trying to provide large and varied portfolios, attractive\nprices, promotions, new products, gift packages and communication. The industry is dynamic and very\ncompetitive.\nFoodservice sales of packaged food are projected to record growth of 1% in 2016. Food producers are\nexpected to adapt to new trends and offer foodservice operators a variety of new products that are\nconvenient and easy to prepare. It is anticipated that most operators will adapt to the health and wellness\ntrend and fast-changing consumer tastes by searching for innovations.\nManufacturers and foodservice providers recognize the importance of customer satisfaction. The\ndevelopment of foodservice is associated with the predicted growth of tourism in the country. This\nimplies the upgrading of hotels and restaurants, improved services and better quality food. The activities\nof packaged food companies are motivated by increased requirements in terms of the quality of food and\nbeverages.\nThe competition in foodservice is expected to intensify over the forecast period. Both local and\nimported brands and products will compete for sales and shares. Competition is likely to focus on the\nquality of products and services (regular daily supplies, variety in pack sizes, frequent price promotions\nand the renewal of portfolios). It is anticipated that foreign companies will concentrate on higher addedvalue product types, such as dairy-based and ice cream desserts, soup, ready meals and sauces, while\ndomestic companies will compete effectively in dairy, bakery, processed meat and oils and fats.\n\nC. Company Profiles\nMeat Processing – Annual production of processed meat in Bulgaria has been estimated at U.S. $463\n\n\u000cmillion.

Its\nproduction is situated in two plants – chocolate and biscuits in Sofia and ice cream in Varna. The second\nbiggest company is Mondelez Bulgaria (former Kraft Foods) with U.S. $157 million annual turnover.\nThe chocolate and sugar confectionery categories are expected grew by 2.5% in 2015 as compared to\nthe previous year. In chocolate confectionery the penetration of private label lines in retail, most notably\nof Lidl and Kaufland, will bring additional price pressures and consumers are expected to make more\npurchases at lower price points. The better expected volume performance in sugar confectionery is seen\nto be a result of interest in new products launched in 2014 and continuing new product development.\nMore producers are expected to follow in the steps of Zaharni Zavodi and Haribo GmbH \u0026 Co and\nlaunch products with natural ingredients, such as fruit juice and pectin.\n\nTop 10 Confectionery Companies in Bulgaria\nAnnual Turnover Million U.S. $\nCompany\nNestle Bulgaria AD\n191.9\nMondelez Bulgaria Production EOOD\n157.3\nZaharni Zavodi AD\n105.6\nZaharen Kombinat Plovdiv AD\n54.9\nPrestige 96 AD\n44.8\nZaharni Izdelia Varna EOOD\n33.7\nDen I Nosht Ltd\n21.1\nPobeda AD\n18.3\nSI Commercial 7 EOOD\n14.5\nKarmela 2000 Ltd\n7.9\nSource: Regal Magazine based on official annual reports\n\n\u000cSoft Drinks – the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages (including mineral water) registered an\nincrease in consumption by 11 million liters as compared to the previous year.

The best performers\nstarted from a lower base, such as ready to drink (RTD) coffee and offered products considered modern\nand healthy (RTD tea, sports and energy drinks, and bottled water). The market is divided between\nmultinational and local companies. Categories such as carbonates, RTD tea, RTD coffee, sports and\nenergy drinks are dominated by multinationals. In carbonates this is due to the strong position of the\nundisputable leader in this category Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company with more than five times\nhigher turnover than the company ranked second Devin. The sixth company in this rating Bankia is also\npart of Coca-Cola HBC. Generally, local companies are stronger in categories that rely on locally\nsourced inputs – fruit juice, concentrates and bottled water.

Food Standards and Regulations\nBulgarian food standards and regulations are harmonized with those of the EU. Phytosanitary and\nsanitary control is applied to imported and exported goods with plant and animal origin. Legislation is\nharmonized with the EU concerning the food safety and marketing standards. For each stage of the\nfood chain from the plant and animal products to the final customer there are EU harmonized\nrequirements for working conditions and hygiene. The local food industry has introduced the HACCP\nsystem as well in a number of facilities.\nU.S. companies are advised to observe strict product labeling requirements, which require that any\nhealth or nutritional claim be first assessed and approved by the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency and\nMinistry of Agriculture and food and then added to the prescriptions on product package. The label\nmust also be translated into Bulgarian. It should contain the type of product, its name, the names of the\nmanufacturer and importer, the full content of the product, shelf life and others. The country introduced\nsome specific requirements for labeling of certain products. For example, if a dairy product contains\nvegetable oil its label may not contain the word \"dairy product\" and must be labeled indicating\n\"Imitation Product Containing Milk\". Additionally, cheese containing vegetable oils cannot be offered\nas cheese, but should be indicated as product containing vegetable oil. In shops, mandatory coloring of\nthe labels was introduced – labels of dairy products containing vegetable oils must be white.\nFor more information on labeling requirements and food standards, especially for recently imposed\nrequirements for organic food products, please refer to the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) U.S. Embassy Sofia.\nAdditional information can be found on the web pages of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) or\nthe Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA).\n\nSection III.

The aid package is similar to last year’s package, as it also\nincludes €150 million for reducing milk production on a voluntary basis. The remaining €350 million is\ndistributed among the Member States, which can top up their envelope with national aid. The seven\npoint package includes further market measures for dairy and a market withdrawal program for fruit and\nvegetables.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nOn July 18, 2016, European Union (EU) Agricultural Ministers agreed on a new €500 million support\npackage from the European Commission. This is a much larger package than the €300 million\nanticipated and is very similar to the previous €500 million package that was agreed to in October\n2015. Similar to last year, the package again consists of a €150 million program for the reduction of\nmilk production on a voluntary basis, while the remaining €350 million is allocated to Member States\nfor conditional support programs that can be added to by MS co-funding. Other measures, including for\nfruit and vegetables, complete the seven point “solidarity” package.\nJuly 2016: 7-point Solidarity Package for Agriculture\n1. Milk production reduction scheme: €150 million will be used to support a voluntary reduction of EU\nmilk deliveries. This scheme will operate at the EU level so that farmers across the Union have access to\nit under the same conditions.\n2. Conditional adjustment aid: €350 million will be used to implement measures at Member State level\n(see below for amounts per Member State). MS may increase the aid amount by 100%.\n3. Voluntary Coupled Support: Member States are given the possibility to review their Voluntary\nCoupled Support (VCS) arrangements for the dairy sector to ensure that the payment is decoupled in\n2017.\n4. Extension of the public intervention for skimmed milk powder (SMP) beyond 30 September: The\npublic intervention for SMP will be extended until end of February 2017, when the standard period\nresumes. The ceiling for SMP bought-in at fixed price stays at 350,000 tons until the end of December\n2016.\n5. Extension of the private storage aid schemes for SMP: Both the standard (between 90 and 210 days\nstorage) and the enhanced (365 day storage) SMP schemes will be extended until the end of February\n2017.\n6. Advance payments: Advances will be increased to 70% for direct payments from 16 October 2016\nand 85% for area-based rural development payments after finalization of the administrative checks.\n7. Fruits and vegetables: Support will be updated for withdrawals made by producer organizations in the\nfruit and vegetables sector.\n\nThe breakdown of the €350 million aid package by MS is as follows, along with a comparison to last\n\n\u000cyears' package:\nNational Envelopes\nMember State\nJuly 2016/Euro Oct. 2015/Euro\nBelgium\n10,979,636\n13,049,568\nBulgaria\n5,809,941\n6,004,009\nCzech Republic\n10,346,106\n11,155,561\nDenmark\n9,294,305\n11,103,077\nGermany\n57,955,101\n69,233,789\nEstonia\n8,081,123\n7,561,692\nIreland\n11,086,327\n13,734,230\nGreece\n1,683,910\n2,258,253\nSpain\n14,665,678\n25,526,629\nFrance\n49,900,853\n62,899,543\nCroatia\n1,517,133\n1,812,383\nItaly\n20,942,300\n25,017,897\nCyprus\n297,165\n354,997\nLatvia\n9,760,362\n8,452,333\nLithuania\n13,298,661\n12,631,869\nLuxembourg\n560,115\n669,120\nHungary\n9,543,566\n9,505,286\nMalta\n100,092\n119,570\nNetherlands\n22,952,419\n29,937,209\nAustria\n5,863,491\n7,004,590\nPoland\n22,670,129\n28,946,973\nPortugal\n3,988,059\n4,764,178\nRomania\n10,896,083\n11,145,958\nSlovenia\n1,145,506\n1,368,433\nSlovakia\n2,062,803\n2,464,247\nFinland\n7,521,715\n8,985,522\nSweden\n6,881,425\n5,220,625\nUnited Kingdom\n30,195,996\n36,072,462\nEU\n350,000,000\n420,000,000\nSource: European Commission\n\n\u000c","similarList":"EU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\nStone Fruit Report 2016_Berlin_Germany_7-21-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nRetail Food Sector Report_Prague_Slovakia_8-2-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nRetail Market Update_Sofia_Bulgaria_7-14-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nRussian Agricultural Policy and Situation Bi-Weekly Update - 10_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-20-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nOilseeds Market Update_Vienna_EU-28_8-3-2016.txt\nNile Nuggets for July 2016_Cairo_Egypt_7-24-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Annual 2016_Dakar_Senegal_7-19-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\n","title":"EU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt","summary":"EU Announces New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package\nOn July 18, 2016, the EU approved a new €500 million support package for European farmers that are\npoint package includes further market measures for dairy and a market withdrawal program for fruit and\nOn July 18, 2016, European Union (EU) Agricultural Ministers agreed on a new €500 million support\nmilk production on a voluntary basis, while the remaining €350 million is allocated to Member States\n1.

The new measure is an attempt to stop leakages in the subsidy\nsystem, as well as ensuring that it reaches the intended end-users. The government is also studying the\npossibility of setting price controls for non-subsidized infant powdered milk. Prices have increased by\nan average of 30-40 percent during the last couple of months. To address the high prices, the\ngovernment, through a direct purchase, procured U.S. powdered milk formula that will be available by\nNovember.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nReforming the Subsidy Program\nShortages of subsidized infant powdered milk has always been a nagging problem in Egypt, however, it\nhas been accentuated with the current forex crunch. Reports indicate that shortages reached crisis levels\nin several governorates, prompting the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) to intervene by\nsending extra shipments of subsidized milk to meet their needs. Members of Parliament have summoned\ngovernment officials to explain the reasons behind the shortage, and the price increases of the nonsubsidized infant powdered milk.\nUnder the subsidized program, the MoHP stated that it secures strategic reserve enough for six months\nof consumption and the quantities distributed are enough to meet local consumption. However,\nbeneficiaries are accusing the authorized pharmacies of profit-seeking selling the subsidized milk at\nhigher prices. They also allege that senior employees of the Egyptian Pharmaceutical Trading\nCompany, a subsidiary of the MoHP’s pharmaceutical holding company in charge of distributing drugs\nand the subsidized infant formula, are siphoning the formula and selling it to bakers. The ongoing\ncomplaints and shortages impelled the government to set new policies in an effort to improve the\nsubsidy system, offering three different types of subsidized infant powdered milk:\n\nAge\n\nFormula for\nInfants\n1 day - 6\nmonths age\n“Red Can”\nFormula for\nInfants\n1 day - 6\nmonths age\n”Green\nCan”\nFollow-up\nFormula for\nInfants\nOver 6\nmonths age\n“Blue Can”\n\nFully or\nPartially\nSubsidized\nFully\n\nTable (1): Children’s Subsidized Powdered Milk\nSubsidized\nActual Price Paid by MoHP\nPrice\nFor\nBeneficiaries\nEGP 3/can\nThe average price of the product\n($0.33 cents)\npaid by the government in the\nlast tender occurred in April\n2016 was EGP 26/can ($2.9)\n\nPartially\n\nEGP 17/can\n($1.9)\n\nPartially\n\nEGP 18/can\n($2)\n\nAverage Market\nPrice for Similar\nProduct\nThe average market\nprice for similar\nproduct is EGP 6080/can ($6.7-9)\n\nStarting on August 1, 2016, beneficiaries eligible for the fully subsidized infant powdered milk formula,\nthe red can, must use their smart cards to get their allowances. According to MoHP, beneficiaries have\nto meet the following conditions: the mother is not capable of breastfeeding her infant, passed-away,\ndelivered more than one child, has a disease(s) that prevents her from breastfeeding, or takes medicines\ncan negatively affect the child through her milk.\nIn order to obtain the smart card, beneficiaries must apply at any of the Egyptian Postal Service’s\n\n\u000cbranches with the supporting documents and MoHP’s approval. Beneficiaries will receive their monthly\nallowance using their smart cards at MoHP’s Maternal and Child Centers that are equipped with card\nreaders. MoHP stated that it has around 1005 centers in all governorates equipped with the card reading\nmachines.\nFor the partially subsidized powdered infant milk, the green and blue cans for children above 6 months,\nbeneficiaries will obtain their allowances from any pharmacy registered with MoHP, and do not require\na smart card but the child’s birth certificate will suffice. Under the reformed program, each eligible\nchild receives a total of 64 cans of infant formula, of which 40 cans of fully subsidized red cans during\nhis first six months age, and the other 24 cans after the age of six months.\nThe government has allocated EGP 600 million ($67.5 million) in FY2016/17 general budget to\nsubsidize pharmaceutical and infant milk subsidy programs. Government said that so far around EGP\n500 million ($56 million) spent in FY2015/16 to buy around 23 million cans of powdered milk (one can\nis 366 grams) compared to 19 million cans purchased in FY2014/2015.\nThe MoHP procures the infant powdered milk formula through international tenders. The Egyptian\nPharmaceutical Trading Company, the local agent of four branded infant powdered milk companies in\nSwitzerland, Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey, won the last tender announced on April 2016.\nPrice Hikes\nThe government is taking extra efforts to control price increases of non-subsidized infant powdered milk, as\n\nthese have increased by nearly 40 percent since April. At the time, a can of non-subsidized infant\npowdered milk formula sold at EGP 45-55 ($5), and is now currently selling at EGP 60-80/can ($6.79). In July 2016, the government announced that MoHP’s Holding Company for Pharmaceuticals\nsigned a contract with a U.S. company to supply infant powdered milk formula to the local market. The\ngovernment said that the first shipment contains around one million cans and is expected to be available\nby early November, which should address shortages as well as driving prices down. The milk will be\nsold under the local brand “Egymilk” at a fixed price of EGP 33/can ($3.7). Traditionally, the U.S. has\nnot been a supplier, so it was a welcoming development that a U.S. supplier was able to break into the\nEgyptian market (figure 2).\n\n\u000cIn June 2016, Egypt’s total population reached 91 million people. According to Egypt’s Central Agency\nfor Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), Egypt’s population growth rate is one of country’s\nmost important challenges. In 2015, the population growth rate recorded 2.4 percent, five times the rate\nin developed countries, and doubles the rate in developing countries. With this growth rate, over 2\nmillion Egyptian babies are born every year, demanding significant quantities of imported infant\nformula (figure 3).\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Government Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nGVN issues Decree sanctioning violations in plant quarantine_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-25-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nRussian Agricultural Policy and Situation Bi-Weekly Update - 10_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-20-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nDraft SPS Measure to WTO_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nRetail Food Sector Report_Prague_Slovakia_8-2-2016.txt\n","title":"Government Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt","summary":"Government Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August 1,\npossibility of setting price controls for non-subsidized infant powdered milk.\ngovernment officials to explain the reasons behind the shortage, and the price increases of the nonsubsidized infant powdered milk.\nStarting on August 1, 2016, beneficiaries eligible for the fully subsidized infant powdered milk formula,\nFor the partially subsidized powdered infant milk, the green and blue cans for children above 6 months,\nThe MoHP procures the infant powdered milk formula through international tenders.\nThe government is taking extra efforts to control price increases of non-subsidized infant powdered milk, as","keywords":"price prices report reports","latentTopics":"milk, infant, formula, subsidized, powdered, government, months, egp, mohp, million"}

According to Euromonitor, in 2015 the sales in modern grocery\nretail reached almost BGN 5.4 billion (U.S. $3.05 billion) and held a combined market share of 55%,\nwhich is likely to slightly increase to 56% in 2016, and 57% in 2017 (see table 2 and 3). The remaining\n45% or almost BGN 4.4 billion (U.S. $2.5 billion) was held by almost 35,900 traditional grocery outlets\nthroughout the country. Although the traditional retail is losing positions, in 2015 independent small\ngrocers remained the largest grocery channel in terms of value sales with BGN 2.8 billion (U.S. $1.42\nbillion) compared to modern trade channel sales of BGN 1.9 billion (U.S. $1.08 billion) in supermarkets\nand BGN 1.56 billion (U.S. $890 million) in hypermarkets. This is a result of a good combination of\nconvenience and budget focus offered by small grocers. According to CEOs of the biggest retail chains\noperating in Bulgaria, they will continue to open new outlets, to optimize their networks, and close lossmaking outlets. They expect that discounters will see the most dynamic market growth.\nNote: Average 2015 Exchange rate 1.0 U.S. $=1.76 Bulgarian leva (BGN).

Some\nretailers took advantage of the market restructuring and expanded the number of outlets since 2014 as\nfollows: Kaufland opened 6 new outlets (currently 55 outlets); Billa opened 9 outlets (currently 100\noutlets), Lidl opened 4 outlets (currently 79 outlets); CBA with 7 new (currently 204 outlets), Fantastico\n\n\u000cwith 2 new (currently 38 outlets – only in Sofia); T-Market – 3 new outlets (currently 47 outlets); 345\nwith 4 new outlets (currently 17 outlets).\n\nRetailer\nKaufland\nBulgaria\nLidl Bulgaria\nBilla Bulgaria\nCBA\nFantastico\nCarrefour\nPenny Market\nPiccadilly\nMetro Cash \u0026\nCarry\nT-Market\n\nTable 4 Top 10 Retailers and Number of Outlets\nOutlets\nOutlets\nOwner\nNationality Opened\n(2010)\n(2014)\nSchwarz\nGroup\nGermany\n2003\n35\n47\nSchwarz\nGroup\nGermany\n2010\n25\n72\nREWE\nGroup\nGermany\n1999\n84\n91\nCBA\nBulgaria\n2003\n156\n197\nValeri\nNikolov\nBulgaria\n1991\n33\n36\nCMB\nFrance\n2008\n5\n22\nREWE\nGroup\nGermany\n2009\n47\n49\nAP Mart\nBulgaria\n1994\n31\n54\nMetro\nMaxima\nGroup\n\nOutlets\n(2015)\n55\n79\n100\n204\n38\n13\n0\n21\n\nGermany\n\n1999\n\n13\n\n15\n\n15\n\nLithuania\n\n2005\n\n33\n\n44\n\n47\n\nThe trend of optimization of retailers’ store numbers emerged starting in 2011 when some local retailers\nhad to shut down/sell outlets: Piccadilly purchased 2 outlets from Elemag, T-Market bought the outlets\nof local chain Kalea, the regional retailer Sani sold its outlets to another regional player, Lexi. In June\n2014, after three years in Bulgaria, the Delhaize Group sold the Piccadilly chain to the local company\nAP Mart. In February 2015 Piccadilly (AP Mart) merged with Carrefour Bulgaria (owned by the\nBulgarian KMB Bulgaria, a subsidiary of the Greek Marinopoulos Group) and became the fourth largest\nfast moving consumer goods (FMCG) player on the market. Only nine months later, in July 2015 they\nannounced that the merge has not been successful and they will continue their operations separately. As\na result Carrefour closed 9 outlets in 2015 and continues to close more outlets. Piccadilly, which opened\ntheir 54th outlet in 2014 had to close 30 outlets and is undergoing a complete restructuring of the\nbusiness model. In September 2015 discount chain Penny, part of the German REWE Group, announced\nclosure of all outlets and complete withdrawal from Bulgaria and vacated a 200 million leva (U.S. $114\nmillion) market. Nine of the closed Penny outlets were transferred to the current number four retailer\nBilla (also part of REWE Group) and the others are still available for interested buyers. These changes\non the market were in favor of the expansion of the top two retailers Kaufland and Lidl, both part of the\nGerman Schwarz Group.\nMarket Players and Shares\nAccording to Euromonitor data and local sources, in 2015 the retail market was estimated at close to 10\nbillion leva (U.S. $5.7 billion).\n\n\u000cA quick look over the top retailers (table 5) shows that for years the larger shares are divided among\nforeign representatives, as the top four leaders are owned by German companies. Before November\n2014 the European hegemony was even stronger in the top 10 with Piccadilly being owned by the\nBelgian company Delhaize, but after it was acquired by the Bulgarian AP Mart the picture slightly\nchanged.\nThe retail sector’s distinguished leader is Kaufland with one-third of the total sales in top 10 for 2015.\nIn 2012 the German discounter surpassed its main competitor Metro and took the lead position. In 2013,\nfor the first year, the chain passed the revenue limit of 1 billion leva (U.S. $779.4 million). Kaufland’s\nmarket share in 2015 is estimated at 13.2% with a revenue of almost BGN 1.5 billion (U.S. $845,000),\nfollowed by Metro with 7.1%, Lidl with 6.3%, and Billa with 5.5%. The only local player among the\nlead retailers is Fantastiko, which currently operates 38 outlets situated only in the capital city Sofia. For\n2016 Kaufland is planning to increase its market share by at least 1-2%, to open a new outlet in Stara\nZagora, and to research potential for building of new outlets. Lidl is also planning to continue their\nexpansion by opening three new outlets – in Sofia, Blagoevgrad, and Kazanlak. They also invested 80\nmillion leva (U.S. $45.5) in a second logistics base. Billa’s plan is to regain third position by opening 50\nnew outlets within the next three years. Metro will develop the supply chain with their professional\ncustomers of the HRI segment along with the traditional cash \u0026 carry model. They’ll continue to\ndevelop their partnership with small traders through “My Store” franchise program.\nThe year 2015 was good for Metro as it increased sales and stabilized the financial results, according to\nan interview with the CEO. When Metro was a single player in the Bulgarian market, it enjoyed high\nrevenue and profit levels, but after the entrance of Billa first, then Kaufland and Lidl next, the\ncompetitive advantages of Metro weakened. Currently the company is rebuilding its strategy in order to\nchange this situation and regain a leading position. The third largest food chain among retailers in\nBulgaria after Kaufland and Metro is the German discounter Lidl with revenue of 647.61 million leva\n(U.S. $367.96) in 2015. The chain has seen more than 20% increase of sales in 2015. The company\nopened 79 stores since it set food in Bulgaria in 2010 and it is not a surprise that it surpassed Billa and\nbecame number three. Billa ranked fourth with a revenue of 575.93 million leva (U.S. $327.23 million),\nand aims to open 150 outlets by 2018.\nThe chain with the highest revenue increase is the Bulgarian company Fantastico. It is one of the few in\nthe ranking list that has never changed ownership since its establishment. It ranks fifth with revenue of\nmore than 398 million leva (U.S. $226 million) in 2015. This represents an increase of more than 11%\ncompared to the previous year.\nTable 5 Top 9 Food Retail Chains in Bulgaria\n\n1\n\n2\n\nKAUFLAN\nD\nBULGARI\nA\nMETRO\nCASH \u0026\nCARRY\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n984,0\n00\n\n1,107,5\n81\n\n1,322,4\n06\n\n1,487,2\n22\n\n664,8\n65\n\n779,9\n87\n\n751,3\n67\n\n845,0\n13\n\n698,200\n\n556,7\n16\n\n513,7\n32\n\n384,4\n89\n\n396,7\n05\n\n823,9\n39\n\n729,500\n\n676,700\n\n\u000c8\n\nLIDL\nBULGARI\nA\nBILLA\nBULGARI\nA\nFANTASTI\nCO\nPENNY\nMARKET\nPICCADIL\nLY\nTMARKET\n\n9\n1\n0\n\nCBA\nCARREFO\nUR\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n385,0\n62\n490,3\n60\n306,0\n00\n193,8\n08\n196,8\n87\n126,1\n77\nN/A\n245,2\n53\n\n428,316\n\n538,264\n\n647,607\n\n497,273\n\n521,155\n\n575,926\n\n341,266\n\n358,236\n\n398,729\n\n195,000\n\n206,849\n\n178,705\n\n191,965\n\n198,715\n\n159,089\n\n133,652\n\n140,043\n\n154,851\n\n81,587\n\n88,695\n\n109,786\n\n257,474\n\n144,644\n\n59,626\n\n260,1\n77\n\n301,6\n31\n\n305,8\n32\n\n367,9\n59\n\n331,3\n24\n206,7\n57\n130,9\n51\n133,0\n32\n85,25\n5\n\n350,1\n92\n240,3\n28\n137,3\n24\n135,1\n87\n94,12\n1\n57,45\n6\n181,3\n20\n\n296,1\n11\n203,5\n43\n117,5\n28\n112,9\n06\n79,57\n0\n50,39\n5\n82,18\n4\n\n327,2\n31\n226,5\n51\n101,5\n37\n90,39\n1\n87,98\n4\n62,37\n8\n33,87\n8\n\nN/A\n165,7\n11\nBGN\n1.48\n\nBGN\n1.42\n\nBGN\n1.76\n\nBGN\n1.76\n\nSource: www.capital.bg\nNote: the above table shows both BGN and U.S. $ as the rate of exchange fluctuated over the years and\na comparison in U.S $ only would be misleading and incorrect.\n\nTrends in Retail Development, Consumption and Shopping Habits\nShopping Frequency - According to the industry, Bulgarian consumers have slightly lowered their\nshopping frequency in 2015, but have spent more without changing significantly the purchase volumes.\nConsumers have spent more money for the same volumes which clearly indicates increases in\nprices. About 20% of consumers do not shop at discounters, usually the youngest and the oldest\nones. Regular consumers at discounters are at 20-49 years age, households with more than one member,\nand those with the highest income. At the same time, especially in smaller towns, grocery stores are\ninformal places for socializing. These habits were one of the reasons for retailers to adopt a new strategy\nto open more convenience stores within 2012/2015.\nMore convenience, mini-market, smaller format shopping outlets - Having already saturated retailing\nopportunities in the capital and major cities, after 2010 most retail chains began to open a new format of\nstore, smaller convenient-type outlets, closer to consumers, downtown or in highly populated residential\nareas. Until a few years ago, these locations belonged to independent groceries while modern retailers\ngrew in the outskirts. However, it turned out that consumer shopping habits do not change quickly and\nBulgarians still prefer to shop more frequently in smaller volume. These stores have longer work hours\nadjusted to the usual work hours of customers. The assortment is limited to more staple products. Unlike\n\n\u000cin other foreign markets, in Bulgaria prices between such convenience stores and hypermarkets are not\nsubstantial because the market is highly fragmented.\nConvenience stores also bring benefits to traditional retailers. Most are not able to withstand the double\npressure from the modern chains and from the economic crisis. Instead of going out of business, these\nplayers prefer to rebrand by becoming part of a more well-known franchise. Smaller outlets, especially\nin small towns, enjoy the advantage of having loyal customers; often shop owners and assistants know\nmany consumers by name; and try to cater individual consumer needs. Finally, rebranding helps foreign\nretailers which sometimes face resistance from local communities which feel that foreign investors may\ndrive local groceries out of business. Another reason for expansion of branded convenient stores is the\nstill depressed real estate market and decline in property prices and rents. The crisis left many empty\nstores in good locations. This allowed retailers to find prime locations since the competition for such\nproperty is not too strong yet.\nAlthough Piccadilly had to close 33 outlets in 2015, Piccadilly Daily is still a leader in convenience\noutlets format with 9 outlets, followed by Metro KOMPAKT - 3 outlets, and T-Market with 3 outlets,\nbring major growth to the market and support higher frequency in shopping. Most retailers plan to keep\nexpanding to smaller format outlets in 2016/2017.\nLoyalty Programs - In addition to expanding outlets, most retailers made efforts to preserve the existing\nnumber of consumers and to turn them into loyal ones. They improved services and offered consumers\nloyalty programs, aggressive advertising, as well as regular price promotions. According to a GfK\nstudy, about 17% in value and in volume of all expenditures for FMCG are made through promotions,\ncompared to 2% in 2005. Some players put emphasis on local and organic products; others began to sell\nfair trade products in order to upgrade their public images. Some chains introduced environmentallyfriendly practices for shopping bags- such as textile or biodegradable bags – a practice which is targeted\nat mainly middle and premium-income costumers.\nPrivate Labels and Price Sensitivity – Bulgarian consumers are known as traditionally price\nsensitive. This is not surprising bearing in mind the fact that Bulgaria remains the EU country with the\nlowest GDP/capita. For 2014 the rate expressed in purchasing power standards (PPS) was 47% of the\nEU average. Compare that to the highest in the EU (Luxemburg) at 257%, and neighbors Romania at\n55%, and Greece at 73% (source: latest Eurostat data). At the same time the difference between the 10%\nwealthiest and poorest 10% of households in the country is massive, with the richest having almost 5\ntimes higher annual income than the poorest 10% of households. The average annual income in 2015 is\n2,530 Euro, up 2.9% compared to 2014 (source: National Statistical Institute).\nFor many consumers price is still the most important purchasing factor. Affordable prices are stated as\nthe main reason for shopping at certain retailers, followed by good quality of products, proximity to\nhome (30% of consumers), and good private labels products (20% of consumers). In a recent study on\nmeasures consumers would take to lower their expenditures, most responders said that they would\nswitch to a cheaper grocery brand. This indicates an opening trend of consumer orientation towards\ndiscounters’ private label products.\nSince 2011 food manufacturers/suppliers have all reported a trend in substitution of higher priced food\nand drinks with their lower priced alternatives. For example the dairy industry reported reduction in\n\n\u000cconsumption and substitution of more expensive products with less expensive products for cheese and\nfresh milk. The same trends were reported by the meat industry – consumption of higher priced\nprocessed meat products declined against less expensive products. The whiskey market faces a similar\ntendency – while consumption in volume is slowly increasing, market value is rather flat and even\nslightly declined. In the past five years the share of products purchased on promotion sharply increased\nfrom 2% in 2005 to 18% in 2015.\nAs a result, all retailers have declared a strategy of lowering prices and keeping the quality in order to\nincrease sales for the past several years. Price sensitivity led to growth in private labels sales. However,\nthe industry reports that private label goods are still not well identified by the customers. One of the\nreasons is that the quality of the products in the lower price segment often falls under reasonable\nlimits. As a result, some retailers do not want to associate their brands with such products and do not\nactively advertise their own private labels. Additionally, the private label brands are usually very\nrational and strictly balance between price and quality, without adding an emotional element. The\nBulgarian consumer is still very open to advertising, which automatically provides better positioning to\nwell-advertised industrial brands, and hurts poorly advertised private label brands. Private labels also\nbring benefits to local food manufacturers as most of the food products under private label brands in\nBulgaria are produced domestically, with the exception of some non-perishable products like chocolate\nand confectionery products, which are usually imported. Sometimes this creates problems with the\nconsistency of the quality as the suppliers’ market is very fragmented and this makes it hard to sustain\ncertain quality levels.\nDuring the last five years the share of private label products in food retail remains unchanged around\n10-11%, despite the expansion of discounters. Private labels are in the focus of the retailers who want to\ndevelop and to achieve sustainable growth as they can manage their sales more efficiently through them.\nIn Europe the sales of private label products are growing with Great Britain being a leader with 47%\nmarket share, followed by Netherlands with 42%, Spain with 38%, and France and Germany with 33%.\nPromotions are being used more aggressively in competition for bigger market share. Retailers strive to\nmake more attractive offers in private label category and respond to consumers’ needs by establishing\nproducts very similar to the so called “A” brands. The highest share of private labels can be found at\nmilk desserts category, followed by processed cheese, potato chips, chocolate products, cookies and\nsnacks, and cooking oils.\nIn 2014 discounters had the largest sales of private label products – 70%, followed by cash\u0026 carry 39%, hypermarkets - 32%, and supermarkets with 16%.\nSome chains such as Kaufland and Lidl offer small local manufacturers the chance to sell their private\nlabel products abroad to as many as 40 countries on six continents as well as out in the country. Lidl\nprovides access to foreign markets to many Bulgarian companies and Kaufland helped local companies\nto reach traditional Bulgarian export markets like Romania, Czech Republic, Poland, and Croatia.\nOverall, however, these advantages remain underestimated by food producers. Most are still trying to\nmaintain own brands but admit that the price difference for the same product under their own brand and\nunder the private label is almost double, and the cost of keeping own brands grows so significantly that\nit becomes unaffordable for smaller companies.\nThe consumers’ private label loyalty indicator shows that it is the highest for the products under these\n\n\u000cbrands at discounters (51%), and lower at hypermarkets (39%) and supermarkets (10%).\nOnline Shopping – Internet retailing of groceries remained largely dormant throughout 2015. None of\nthe top four retailers sought to utilize the sales potential that this channel offers. One notable exception\nwas Fantastico, which is the only one to sell groceries through ebag.bg online supermarket. According\nto Euromonitor, internet retailing of food and drinks tripled in value from 2010 to 2015. One of the\nreasons for the slow development of online grocery shopping is that retailers rely heavily on advertising\nin order to mould consumer perception of their price positioning without engaging into actual price\ncompetition. The Internet has potential to rearrange the competitive environment by enabling quick\nprice comparison between stores and thus big retailers is expected to keep avoiding internet retailing,\nwhile smaller grocers will develop this channel. The share of population with internet access is expected\nto reach 70% by 2019. Those not using internet access services are typically elderly people, rural\ninhabitants, or those with low education and income levels. The share of online shopping for foods and\ndrinks is expected to increase in time and the main customers will be the so called Millennials\n(generation with birth age ranging from late 1990s to the early 2000s). It has been forecasted that they\nwill create new expectations for the grocers as in addition to being technology-savvy, this generation\nplan their meals less, putting more emphasis on immediate or same-day consumption. Online grocery\noperations can excel in this environment, with an increasing number of services offering same-day or\neven hourly delivery. One of the greatest challenges before the retailers will be to design business\nmodels to allow for the delivery of fresh food as the current customers online shopping preferences are\nmainly oriented towards non-perishable and shelf-stable products.\nNew Players Entering the Market – Fresh products grocery retailers seemed to be the only category\nwhich was not heavily harmed by the economic crisis due to the fact that groceries are a necessity which\ncannot be cut from the family budget. Although traditional retail yielded precedence to modern trade it\nis likely to witness regain of its positions as it is possible that local economic groups or foreign players\nmay try to take the share of the market that was freed after Penny’s withdrawal and the unsuccessful\nmerging of Piccadilly and Carrefour. Although modern channels have the advantage in virtually all\ncomparisons versus traditional ones, there are still significant market niches where tradition thrives.\nPlayers from non-retail business also started to invest and entered the retail business attracted by its\nstability and expansion. There is an emerging wave of opening small specialized stores for fruit and\nvegetables as well as for dairy and meat products, which focus on consumers convenience and the need\nfor fresh, local, and organic food of high quality, which so far was not the strongest side of the modern\nretailers. Bulgarian retail industry can only gain from this tendency as this would be a sign of a welldeveloped market providing more choices to the consumers through new business models and concepts.\nA new player, the largest Macedonian food retail chain KAM, recently announced an ambitious plan to\nenter the Bulgarian market by opening 20-25 outlets by the end of 2016 and as many as 80 outlets by\n2018. They will apply a “hard discount” model but the scale will not be as big as the competitors in the\nsame category. This means that they will focus on basic foods, short assortment line, in-box display,\nlowest prices for quality products, big share of private label products, and fast service. They will do the\nmarket entry through a small investment of U.S. $3 – 3.5 million in the capital city Sofia with 40% of\nthe products under private label. KAM’s current outlets have considerably small selling space of 250450 square meters (for comparison Lidl outlets in Bulgaria are on 800 – 1000 sq. m.) and offer about\n900 items. They import from Greece, Turkey, Germany, Italy, and other European countries. KAM selfdefines as the Macedonian version of Aldi and also aims to take as much of the share freed up after\n\n\u000cPenny’s withdrawal.\nProspects\nDespite the challenging economic environment, Bulgaria’s GDP has grown modestly between 20112013 with annual growth of about 1%. It has been on the path to recovery since 2014 and reached\nannual growth of 3% in 2015. In 2015 GDP was U.S. $51 billion with a GDP per capita of $6,960. Real\nGDP growth is forecast to slightly decelerate to 2.1% in 2016 before picking up to 2.5% in 2017. The\ngrowth was a result mainly of stable exports and good tourist seasons which supported job creation in\nthe summer. Due to good fiscal policy and macroeconomic indexes, the Bulgaria’s credit rating was\ndetermined as BB+ with “stable outlook” by S\u0026P and Moody’s. The expected decrease in Bulgaria's\nexports, as well as the problems in Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing debt crisis in neighboring\nGreece are expected to be the key factors negatively impacting the country's economic growth\nthroughout the year.\nIn this challenging economic situation, several projections can be made:\n- Competition among retailers will become tougher since consumers spend less but at the same time the\nnumber of retail outlets increases. Consumer price consciousness is expected to dominate in the next\nfew years due to projections for no significant improvement in job creation in medium term as well as\nnegative predictions about the demographic situation and expectations for up to 3% decline of\npopulation. These factors are expected to result in reduction in household budgets and disposable\nincomes and thus reduce purchasing power and demand for grocery retail.\n- Hypermarkets and discounters are expected to keep growing fast in 2016/2017 under the pressure of\nrecession on consumers to shop for cheaper products. Kaufland and Lidl are expected to hold the\nleading positions and to increase their market shares in 2016 by opening new outlets and to become\nincreasingly cost competitive by providing wider product choice. The market share of private labels is\nexpected to increase as well. Convenience stores are expected to be the third fastest growing channel for\ngrocery retailers. Establishment of new chains is also possible as independent small grocers seek to\nrespond to increasing competition by pooling resources.\n- The expansion of retailers to smaller towns and convenience format outlets in 2016 will take more\nmarket share from the independent groceries and thus will further strengthen retailers’ negotiation\npower.\n- Traditional retail is expected to underperform compared to modern trade as large retailers plan to move\ntowards densely populated town centers by opening convenient stores and smaller supermarkets. The\nonly exception will be small specialized stores for fruits, vegetables, and dairy and meat products,\nwhich stake on convenience and fresh produce.\nNote: Exchange rate 1.0 Euro=1.95583 Bulgarian

The overall objective of the project is to improve the cacao value chain in\nColombia by strengthening key agricultural institutions in the public and private sectors through\ncooperative research, technical assistance, and extension education. The Cacao for Peace Initiative will\nprovide these institutions the necessary tools and resources so that Colombia can take advantage of the\nrapidly increasing global demand for chocolate to become a global supplier of cacao, the essential\ningredient in chocolate. This initiative will create economic opportunities for the U.S. chocolate and\nconfectionary industries, American agriculture, and thousands of Colombian farmers and their families.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nInitial Stages\n\n\nValue Chain Analysis (a roadmap for the future) - Purdue University is conducting a value chain\nanalysis of the cacao sector in Colombia to identify opportunities and create a baseline to\nmeasure the effectiveness of the project. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture\n(CIAT) will also map climate change projections to show the future viable areas for cacao in\nColombia in order to focus the geographic reach of the project.\n\n\n\n\nExpected Outcomes - This analysis will be used to create a roadmap to guide the future\nof the project and the cacao industry in Colombia.\n\nCooperative Research - The Colombian Ministry of Agricultural’s main agricultural research\nagency Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (CORPOICA) and USDA’s\nAgricultural Research Service (ARS) will be signing a cooperative agreement in 2016. ARS is a\nleading public research institution in the United States on cacao research. The agreement will\nfocus on genetic diversity collection, breeding activities, disease resistance, and transfer of best\npractices.\n\nPennsylvania State University (PSU), which houses the Endowment in Molecular Biology of Cocoa, is\na leading university in the United States on cacao research. PSU will foster collaboration on the project\nthrough networking, priority development, and cooperative research within the cacao scientific\ncommunity in Colombia and the United States.\n\n\n\n\nExpected Outcomes - This collaboration will result in targeted research to develop\nimproved cacao varieties for Colombia in areas such as the Sierra Nevada.\n\nEducational Partnerships - The Cacao for Peace Initiative will fund four scholarships for\nColombian students to study at Land Grant Universities (LGUs) in the United States towards\nmasters’ degrees in agriculture, specializing in cacao research.\n\nWith the assistance of United Nations United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and PSU,\nwe will establish two education farms in Sierra Nevada to provide training across the cacao value chain.\nPeace Corps Volunteers will be placed at these centers and with cacao producer associations in Sierra\nNevada to provide agricultural extension and marketing education in local communities.\n\n\nExpected Outcomes - The initiative should transform the Caribbean region of Colombia\ninto an incubator for cacao innovation. Successes from the Sierra Nevada education\ncenters will serve as a blueprint to be expanded to other cacao producing regions in\nColombia.\n\nGrowing Partnerships\n\n\u000cTo achieve the objectives of the project, USDA is partnering with USAID, CORPOICA, UNODC, the\nPeace Corps, the Fulbright/Colombia Program, CIAT, SENA (Colombia’s vocational education system)\nand a consortium of nine Land Grant Universities (University of California Davis, Cornell University,\nUniversity of Florida, Michigan State University, New Mexico State University, Pennsylvania State\nUniversity, Purdue University, Texas A\u0026M University, and Washington State University).\n\nPeace Corps Volunteers, FAS officials and UNODC personnel meeting with Arhuaco’s community at\nthe post harvest facility build by the Colombian Government.\nWhy Now?\nCacao is an underdeveloped industry in Colombia, but with the potential for the country to become one\nof the largest producers of cacao in the world. Colombia only produces 50,000 metric tons of cacao\nannually, one fifth of the production in neighboring Ecuador. In addition, rural violence and\nlawlessness have negatively impacted investments and growth in the cacao sector.\nWithin the next few months, the Colombian government should sign a peace agreement with the FARC,\nthe leftist guerrilla group that has been fighting the government for over 50 years. Cacao could play an\nimportant element in the post-accord process. A strong cacao industry would provide economic\nopportunity for hundreds of thousands of small holder farmers and their families, many of whom live in\nconflict areas. Cacao will also provide a strong alternative to coca production.\nThe United States is not a commercial producer of cacao. Nonetheless, the U.S. chocolate and\nconfectionery industries are a principle consumer of key U.S. agricultural commodities such as sugar,\npeanuts, milk, and almonds. For example, for every dollar of cacao imported, between one and two\ndollars of domestic agricultural products are used in the making of chocolate. Thus, the Cacao for\nPeace Initiative could help Colombia become a major supplier of cacao to our growing chocolate\nindustry.\n\n\u000cCacao is the raw material for industries such as confectionary and cosmetics. Colombia has the\npotential to export cacao as commodity or transformed as confectionary.\n\nWhy USDA?\nUSDA is in a superior position to strengthen Colombia’s cacao industry through training and technical\nassistance. Cacao cooperative research and extension are the two key areas targeted for capacity\nbuilding through the CFP. Successful agricultural development is only possible through a centralized\nnational investment in agricultural research complemented by a decentralized extension service capable\nof adapting research to highly varied local conditions. This is what USDA and the LGUs accomplished\nin the United States. USDA and LGUs have over 100 years of experience in cooperative research and\nextension, and are poised to assist Colombia’s cacao industry achieve its potential.\n\nBuilding capacity is not only about infrastructure, but also about training the producer in good\nagronomical and post harvest practices such as the fermenting and drying of cacao beans.\nUSDA also has decades of experience implementing international agricultural development initiatives.\nUSDA contributed to founding the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) and\ndirectly worked with Norman Borlaug and the Rockefeller Foundation to lead the “Green Revolution”\n\n\u000cin developing nations around the world. USDA is represented by the Foreign Agricultural Service\n(FAS) in Colombia and in collaboration with FAS’s Office of Capacity Building and Development\n(OCBD) can facilitate key linkages to internal USDA farm service agencies, such as the Agricultural\nResearch Service (ARS), Cooperative Extension Service, and Land Grant Universities. USDA-ARS has\na long history of work in Latin America. Since 1955 ARS has been involved in cacao research and has\ncollaborating closely with Latin America on several research initiatives.\nIn carrying out the program, USDA intends to use its unique statutory authorities to enter into\ncooperative or cost reimbursable agreements with one or more USDA technical agencies, the Peace\nCorps, Land Grant Universities, and with several local implementing partners. USDA will draft a\ndefined scope of work for each, outlining its contribution to the program. As the participating agency,\nUSDA is responsible for all logistical and administrative assistance to the CFP, including compliance\nwith procedures and regulations regarding international travel.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Cacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nSaborUSA Increases the Popularity of U.S. Food in Colombia_Bogota_Colombia_7-29-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nFAS Canada Assists Small U.S. Exporter_Toronto_Canada_7-19-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nRetail Food Sector Report_Prague_Slovakia_8-2-2016.txt\n","title":"Cacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt","summary":"Agricultural Research Service (ARS) will be signing a cooperative agreement in 2016.\na leading university in the United States on cacao research.\nPeace Initiative could help Colombia become a major supplier of cacao to our growing chocolate\nUSDA is in a superior position to strengthen Colombia’s cacao industry through training and technical\nCacao cooperative research and extension are the two key areas targeted for capacity\nUSDA also has decades of experience implementing international agricultural development initiatives.\n(OCBD) can facilitate key linkages to internal USDA farm service agencies, such as the Agricultural\nResearch Service (ARS), Cooperative Extension Service, and Land Grant Universities.","keywords":"agricultural agriculture cacao","latentTopics":"cacao, usda, research, colombia, agricultural, university, peace, united, states, chocolate"}

Myers\nPrepared By:\nGraham T. Soley / Sunyoung Choi\nReport Highlights:\n2015 Korean potato production decreased eight percent to 546,000 metric tons (MT) from 591,000 MT in\n2014. Although 2014 planted area was larger than 2015, it decreased more than 21 percent from 2013. Large\nproduction in 2013 suppressed domestic prices, thus plantings decreased in 2014. 2015 U.S. exports of fresh\npotatoes to Korea exceeded 22,000 MT, which generated $12.7 million in value, a 49 percent increase in quantity\nover 2014, as a result of increased demand for chipping potatoes. Comparing 2015 to 2012, U.S. exports of\nprepared potato products were 38 percent higher in value, primarily a result of reduced tariffs under the KORUS\nFTA.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nProduction:\nWith cropping patterns varying from Spring, Autumn, and Highland, potatoes are produced and marketed at\ndifferent periods in Korea. The majority of production consists of the “Sumi” variety, a potato that is high in\nstarch and used as table stock. Korea also grows the “Daeji” potato, a variety planted in the southern parts of the\npeninsula during autumn. The “Atlantic” variety is a chipping potato that’s grown when farmers have contracts\nwith potato-chip manufacturers.\nTable 1 provides hectares (Ha) planted and production (TMT) from 2012 to 2015. 2015 Ha planted decreased\nfour percent from 2014 to 20,704, and production decreased eight percent to 546 TMT. Spring led all cropping\npatterns with 67 percent of production, followed by Highland with 24 percent. Adverse weather conditions, such\nas colder weather in the growing season and excessive rain during harvest, may affect yields. Although the 2014\nplanted area was larger than 2015, it decreased more than 21 percent from 2013. Large production in 2013\nsuppressed domestic prices, thus plantings decreased in 2014. Table 2 provides the Production, Supply, and\nDemand (PSD) of Korea’s potato industry from 2012 to 2015. This table shows a trend of increasing imports,\nand a declining self-sufficiency rate in Korea.\nTable 1.

Imports are primarily sourced from Australia and the U.S., as\nFigure 2 presents both countries’ exports from 2011 to 2015. During this period, the U.S. had sustained higher\nmarket share each year. 2014 U.S. exports decreased from 2013, due to West Coast labor disputes that occurred\nfrom 2014 to 2015. 2015 U.S. exports of fresh potatoes to Korea exceeded 22 TMT, which generated $12.7\nmillion in value, and 49 percent higher quantity than 2014. This was a result of increased demand from Korea\nprocessors for chipping potatoes. Processors expanded production to meet demand for honey-butter potato chips,\na sensationally popular snack in Korea (see the Wall Street Journal article http://www.wsj.com/articles/thepotato-chip-frenzy-in-korea-1436371078 for more information).\n\nTable 5.Korea: Fresh Potato Import $ \u0026 MTs from 2012-2015\n\nCountry\nAustralia\nU.S.\nOther\nTotal\n\n2012\n$(1,000) MTs\n9,752\n11,736\n8,469\n15,439\n0\n0\n18,220\n27,176\n\n2013\n$(1,000) MTs\n8,533\n10,310\n9,253\n17,344\n0\n0\n17,786\n27,654\n\n2014\n$(1,000) MTs\n4,282\n5,942\n7,967\n15,257\n22\n13\n12,272\n21,212\n\n2015\n$(1,000) MTs\n8,559\n14,345\n12,658\n22,780\n0\n0\n21,217\n37,125\n\nSource: Korea International Trade Association (KITA)\n\nFigure 2.\nKorea: Fresh Potato Imports (TMT) from Australia \u0026 U.S. (2011-2015)\n\nSource: Korea International Trade Administration (KITA)\n\nA recent FTA between Australia and Korea (effective December 2014), as well as an appreciation of the Korean\nWon (₩) over the Australian Dollar (AUD), has strengthened Australia’s competiveness in the fresh potato\nmarket (See Figure 6 in Appendix for an AUD/₩ time trend). In contrast, the U.S. Dollar (USD) had appreciated\nagainst the Korean Won (See Figure 7 in Appendix for ₩/US). Furthermore, increased demand from the U.S.\nand abroad (e.g. Canada and Japan) had put upward pressure on prices. From January to May of 2016, U.S.\nexports were down 65 percent compared to the same time last year, while Australian exports were up 69 percent.\n\nPrepared Potato products (HS 2004100000)\n\n\u000cWhen compared to 2012, 2015 imports of prepared potato products (primarily French Fries) were 38 percent\nhigher in Korea (See Table 6). Moreover, 2015 imports exceeded $132 million, as U.S. exports generated 81\npercent of the total value. Compared to 2012, 2015 U.S. exports were 24 percent higher, hence the importance of\nKORUS FTA. Figure 3 shows import quantity (% of MT) for various exporters, with the U.S. exporting the\nlargest quantity each year. Note the minimum percent (y-axis) is set at 80 to clearly observe changes between\nother exporters. One noticeable trend is Canada’s increasing market share since 2013, which is somewhat a result\nof the FTA with Korea in 2014.\nTable 6.\nKorea: Prepared Potato Import Dollars \u0026 Metric Tons from 2012-2015\n\nCountry\nU.S.\nCanada\nChina\nBelgium\nNetherlands\nOther\nTotal\n\n2012\n$(1,000) MT\n77,834\n65,807\n2,172\n1,520\n1,576\n777\n883\n833\n3,898\n3,818\n535\n440\n86,897\n73,195\n\n2013\n$(1,000) MT\n93,963\n78,284\n2,221\n1,382\n1,565\n825\n1,842\n1,453\n1,417\n1,205\n947\n574\n101,955 83,723\n\n2014\n$(1,000) MT\n105,126 83,222\n4,940\n3,628\n1,928\n1,026\n1,516\n1,332\n2,285\n1,954\n879\n439\n116,673 91,602\n\n2015\n$(1,000) MT\n107,131 81,821\n9,914\n6,406\n5,120\n3,396\n5,139\n4,774\n3,973\n3,921\n1,603\n1,092\n132,881 101,411\n\nSource: KITA\n\nFigure 3.\n\nKorea: Import quantity (% of MT) of prepared potato products from 2011 to [1/16 - 6/16]\n\nNote: E.U. represents Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands;\nSource: KITA\n\nFrozen Potatoes (HS 0710100000)\nWith 2015 exports at 2,700 MT, frozen potato products constitute a smaller share of total potato exports. 2015\nU.S. exports made up 61 percent of frozen potato exports to Korea.

Reduction in tariffs for U.S. potato products, as a result of\nKORUS FTA, has been noticeably favorable for producers. As a result, 2015 exports were 39 percent higher than\n2012 (KORUS FTA went into effect March 2012).\nFigure 4.\nKorea: Potato Imports1 from U.S. (2011-2015)\n\nNote: 1Imports include Frozen Potatoes (HS 0710100000), Prepared Potato products (HS 2004100000), and Fresh Potatoes (HS 0701900000)\nSource: KITA\n\nFigure 5 presents annual U.S. potato exports from 2011 to 2015, which are differentiated by product\ncategory. Notice that the minimum percent (y-axis) is set at 70 percent, signifying the significant quantity of\nprepared potato products. One can clearly note the year-to-year changes between fresh, frozen, and prepared\npotato products. The increased percentage of fresh potatoes in 2015 was a result of increased demand from chip\nprocessors in Korea.\n\nFigure 5.\nKorea: U.S. Potato Exports1 (% of MTs) from 2011-2015\n\n\u000cNote: 1Imports include Frozen Potatoes (HS 0710100000), Prepared Potato products (HS 2004100000), and Fresh Potatoes (HS 0701900000)\nSource: KITA\n\nKORUS FTA:\nFresh Potato Products (HS 0701900000)\n\n\nTable Stock Potatoes (HS 0701900000a)2\n\nFor table stock, 3,377 MT can be imported with zero duty in 2016, and a 304 percent duty will be imposed for\nvolume exceeding the quota, as the TRQ is set to increase 3 percent annually (See Table 7).

The seasonal duty of 304 percent will be eliminated in\nequal stages from 2019 through 2026 (i.e. declining 20 percent on an annual basis). Regarding Korea’s recent\nFTA with Australia, the same TRQ applies to Australian chipping potatoes. As a result of demand from chip\nprocessors all year round, Korea allows the seasonal window for U.S. and Australian chipping potatoes due to\nlimited domestic supply.\n\nTable 8.

Oregon,\nWashington, and Idaho (except Bingham and Bonneville counties) are allowed to export chipping potatoes.\nPotato spindle tuber viroid, Synchytrium endobioticum (potato wart), Globodera rostochiensis (golden nematode),\nGlobodera pallida, and Zebra chip are the main quarantine pests of concern to Korea. Accordingly, shipments\nfrom all origins are subject to quarantine inspection for the related pest list. Imported fresh potatoes must be\nwashed and be reasonably free of soil and foreign materials.\n\nMarket Characteristics, Threats, \u0026 Opportunities:\nRecently, Australia, Canada, and China signed FTAs with Korea, thus creating a more competitive environment\nfor U.S. potato producers. The U.S. competes with these countries in various potato products in Korea (See\nTable 9). Recently, other constraints have been an appreciating USD and the West Coast Port Strike of 20142015. The strike created opportunities for competitors to access the Korea market, while U.S. producers dealt\nwith logistical issues that prevented exports.\nTable 9. Effective FTAs \u0026 Competitive Category\n\nCountry\nCanada\nAustralia\nChina\n\nFTA Effective\n2014\n2014\n2015\n\nCompetitive Category\nPrepared Potatoes\nFresh Potatoes\nFrozen Potatoes\n\nKorea is one of the top export markets for U.S. potato products, with positive progress made in quick service\nrestaurants (QSRs). This growth included business opportunities in value-added and non-fried frozen\nproducts. There was expansion into pubs, coffee shops, retail outlets, and other venues, making the U.S. a major\nsupplier of fresh, prepared, and frozen potato products.\nSocioeconomic changes have helped incentivize growth in the food industry, as well as Korea’s expanding\npreference for diversity in consumption. With ease of service attracting consumers, large-scale restaurants and\n\n\u000cfoodservice processors have continued to develop market opportunities, while U.S. producers have provided\ncompetitively-priced supply. Increasing demand from large retailers, such as hypermarkets and convenience\nstores, has helped spur changing food behaviors. Thus, U.S. exporters have helped provide Korean firms with a\nconsistent supply of high quality, potato products and the capacity for growth.\nWith the majority of fresh potato imports devoted to processing (chipping potatoes), Korea is reliant on U.S.\nexports for intermediate ingredients. As Korea seeks to export more processed food to global markets, demand\nfor fresh chipping potatoes should increase, especially with snack manufacturers as the primary consumer.\nDemand for U.S. prepared potato products (e.g. French Fries) is greatest among QSRs, as the U.S. is highly\nreputable concerning quality.

Leonardi, Agricultural Attaché\nPrepared By:\nSinem Duyum, Agricultural Specialist\nReport Highlights:\nWithin the scope of Turkey’s harmonization period to be an EU Member, Turkey published an\nimplementing regulation concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to veterinary\ncontrols at introduction into the country to harmonize with the EU Commission Decision\n2007/275/EU (GAIN report dated 4/22/2016 No: TR6020 here). Recently, Turkey’s Ministry of Food,\nAgriculture and Livestock (MinFAL) announced the revised guidelines regarding controls of certain\ncomposite products and products which could be considered as composite products in line with EU\nimplementation. The guideline will be distributed to custom control points- veterinary border\ninspection posts (VBIP) - in Turkey. This instruction will enter in force on August 15, 2016.\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\n1\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nAfter publishing the implementing regulation on concerning lists of animals and products to be\nsubject to veterinary controls at introduction into the country, veterinary border inspection posts\n(VBIP) (or province directorates which have authorization to conduct veterinary controls at the\nborders if there is no VBIP in the region) have been struggling with veterinary controls of animal\nproducts on which products should be considered as composite products, or subjected to veterinary\nhealth certificate. With this new guideline, MinFAL aimed to clarify and reduce confusion for\nveterinary controls for those products by veterinary staff working at borders.\nThis document should help clarify the situation for U.S. products exported to Turkey and give\nguidance on export conditions of certain composite products containing processed products of animal\norigin and plant products as well as for products containing different products of animal origin and\nfor products containing unprocessed products of animal origin and plant products.\nDefinition of Composite Product\nTurkey defines composite product as a foodstuff intended for human consumption that contains both\nprocessed products of animal origin and products of plant origin and includes those where the\nprocessing of primary product is an integral part of the production of the final product.\nAlso it is defined that the below combinations are not considered as composite products;\n1. A non-processed product of animal origin associated with a product of plant origin and placed\non the market as such (e.g. skewer containing fresh meat/fish and vegetables)\n2. Products not intended for human consumption (e.g. canned tuna fish with corn for pet food)\n3. Products of processed animal origin if no products of plant origin are included. (e.g.\naquaculture products as fish sauce obtained from fermentation of a mixture of fish, salt and\nwater. Dairy product as yogurt drink obtained milk powder and sugar. They do not contain\nany plant ingredient required to be composite products.)\nProducts of processed animal origin containing plant ingredient\nAdding plant ingredient into product of processed animal origin does not always mean that the final\nproduct is a composite product. If plant ingredient is necessary for production process of processed\nanimal origin product or plant ingredient in question adds special characteristics to final product; the\nfinal product is not a composite product but is considered as a product of processed animal origin.\nFor example;\n\n1. Cheeses to which herbs are added or yogurts to which fruit is added remain dairy products.\n2. Sausages to which garlic or soya is added remain meat products.\n3. Tuna fish to which sunflower oil is added for the purpose of can production technology\nremains aquaculture product.\n4. Surimi to which plant ingredient is added to give specific characteristics remains aquaculture\nproduct.\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\n2\n\n\u000c5. Chicken nugget breaded for adding specific characteristics (flavor, texture) remains meat\nproduct.\n6. Canned beef to which glucose or onion in small quantity is added for adding specific\ncharacteristics remains meat product.\n7. Milk puddings to which fruit sauces are added for adding specific characteristics (flavor)\nremains dairy product.\n8. Breaded cheese for adding specific characteristics (flavor, texture) remains dairy product.\nDecision tree to distinguish composite product from products of animal origin\n\nA non-exhaustive list with examples of processed products of animal origin is detailed in Annex 1 to\nthis report.\nProducts of unprocessed animal products and plant products\nA non-processed product of animal origin associated with a product of plant origin is considered as a\nnon-processed product of animal origin, for example:\n\n1. Skewer containing fresh meat and vegetables,\n2. Preparations of fresh fishery products with food of plant origin,\n3. Honey with nuts (Honey is not processed and the final product is not processed/ not heated),\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\n3\n\n\u000c4. Uncooked pastry with fresh meat.\nCombinations of products of animal origin\nFood products which contain different products of animal origin, independently on whether they are\nunprocessed or processed, are not considered to be composite products if no products of plant origin\nare included. For example;\n1. Fish ball with very small amount of egg white used as thickener,\n2. Skewers with meat marinated in yoghurt, milk,\n3. Surimi to which very small amount of egg white is added for technological reasons,\n4. Steak presented in a package with a piece of butter,\n5. Whole fish, ready to cook, presented with a meat stuffing,\n6. Sushi decorated with egg products.\nAssessment of whether composite products are subjected to veterinary controls or not\nThe commodities which are not in Annex I of Turkey’s implementing regulation on concerning lists\nof animals and products to be subject to veterinary controls at introduction into the country\n(also see the GAIN report dated 4/22/2016 No: TR6020 or click here) should not undergo veterinary\nchecks.\nThe following composite products shall be subject to veterinary controls:\n1. Composite products containing processed meat product.\n2. Composite products containing half or more of their substance of any one processed product\nof animal origin other than processed meat product.\n3. Composite products containing no processed meat product and less than half of their\nsubstance of processed milk product where the final products do not meet the requirements\ndefined by specific national legislation.\nThe legislation refers to \"any one processed product of animal origin other than processed meat\nproduct\" contained in a composite product, which means that there can be more than one processed\nproduct of animal origin in a composite product. In this case, all processed product of animal origin\ningredients need to be summed up to know if the total amount of contained processed product of\nanimal origin is 50 percent or more in the composite product and therefore the relevant composite\nproduct is subject to a veterinary control.\nIn addition, the legislation provides derogation for composite products which are shelf stable at\nambient temperature or have clearly undergone in their manufacture a complete cooking or heat\ntreatment process throughout their substance and are not containing any meat products but containing\nless than half of their substance of any one processed product of animal origin other than processed\nmeat product. In this case, heat treated throughout the substance should be enough so that any raw\nproduct is denatured. Mild heat treatment such as pasteurization is not considered effective method\nfor denaturation.\nComposite products listed in Annex II of Turkey’s implementing regulation on concerning lists of\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\n4\n\n\u000canimals and products to be subject to veterinary controls at introduction into the country (also\nsee the GAIN report dated 4/22/2016 No: TR6020 or click here) do not need to be subject to\nveterinary checks. However if final composite product not subjected to veterinary controls is treated\nfurther with treatment such as adding cream to cake, the product might be under veterinary controls.\nDecision tree for composite products subject to veterinary controls or not\nThe following documents are requested from producers/exporting country while the decision is taken\nwhether product is subjected to veterinary controls or not:\n1. Percentage of each product of animal origin\n2. Details of production process of composite product (the points that animal ingredients are\nadded to the product, following heat treatment especially heat-time details and work plan\nflow showing core temperature reached)\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\n5\n\n\u000cAnnex 1 –\nA non-exhaustive list with examples of processed products of animal origin.\nAccording to the instruction; processed products are obtained by any action substantially changing\nthe initial product, including heating, smoking, curing, maturing, drying, marinating, extraction,\nextrusion or a combination of those processes.\nProcessed products of animal origin include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeat products (e.g. ham, salami)\nProcessed fishery products (e.g. smoked fish, marinated fish, surimi etc)\nDairy products (e.g. heat treated milk, cheese, yoghurt)\nEgg products (e.g. egg powder)\nRendered animal fat\nGreaves\nGelatin\nCollagen\nTreated intestines, stomachs and bladders etc.\nCombinations of processed products, e.g. cheese with ham\nProducts that have undergone several processing operations, e.g. cheese from pasteurized\nmilk.\n\nSubstances to give special characteristics (e.g. flavor, sweetness, color, texture) or for technical\npurposes may be added, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsausage with garlic\nyoghurt with fruit\ncheese with herbs or breaded cheese\ndairy ice cream with chocolate\ncanned fish fillet in oil\ncooked mussels with garlic butter\nsurimi with egg parts\nfried battered fish\n\nAdditionally the instruction gives examples of composite products and processed products of animal\norigin:\nPicture\n\nCN code\n\nProduct\ninformation\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\nComments\n\n6\n\n\u000c1604 14\n11\n\nTuna steak\nIngredients: Tuna\nfish, sunflower\nand salt.\n\n1604 15\n\nMackerel in\ntomato\nsauce\nIngredients: jack\nmackerel, tomato\nsauce, water and\nsalt\n\n1904 90\n10,\nif fish\ncontent\nis less\nthan\n20%\n1604\n(frozen\nor not),\nif fish\ncontent\nis\nmore\nthan\n20%\n1604 20\n10\n\nSushi\nIngredients: fish,\nsushi rice, palm\nleaves, and\nothers.\n\nNot considered as\ncomposite product\nsince it is aquaculture\nproduct.\nSubject to veterinary\ncontrols.\nNot considered as\ncomposite product\nsince it is aquaculture\nproduct.\nSubject to veterinary\ncontrols.\nNot considered as\ncomposite product\nsince it contains raw\nfish.\nSubject to veterinary\ncontrols.\n\nSalmon salad\n\nComposite product,\n\nIngredients: pink\nsalmon, sweet\nand sour sauce\n(tomato sauce,\nwater, vinegar,\nsoybean oil,\nsugar, modified\nstarch, salt),\ntomato, sweet\ncorn, onion,\ngreen pepper,\nbaby corn, flavor,\n\nNot subject to\nveterinary\nchecks as less than 50\n%\nfishery products\nand shelf-stable\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\n7\n\n\u000c1602 50\n31\n\n1602 50\n95\n\n1902 20\n\nenhancer (E621),\npaprika color\n(E160c)\nCanned Beef\nIngredients:\ncooked beef, salt,\nsugar, water and\npreservative\n(Sodium Nitrite –\nE250)\nCanned Minced\nBeef\nIngredients: beef,\nwater, wheat\nflour, beef\nextract,\nsalt, corn flour,\nsugar, natural\ncolor (plain\ncaramel), natural\nonion flavor,\nmaltodextrin\nand white pepper\nBeef Lasagna\nIngredients:\ncooked minced\nbeef, vegetables\nand pasta with a\nbéchamel\nsauce topping\ncontaining milk\nand cheese.\n\nComposite Products Subject to Veterinary Controls: Turkey\n\nMeat product,\nSubject to\nveterinary checks\n\nMeat product as the\nplant ingredients just\nadd special\ncharacteristics;\nSubject to veterinary\nchecks\n\nComposite product,\nSubject to veterinary\nchecks\nas it contains meat\nproduct\n\n8\n\n\u000c1602, if\nmeat\ncontent\nis\nmore\nthan\n20%\n2106, if\nmeat\ncontent\nis\nless than\n20%\n\n1604\n\n2106 90\n98\n\nCanned Chili\nwith beans,\nIngredients:\nwater, beef,\nbeans,\nconcentrated\ncrushed\ntomatoes, corn\nflour, textured\nvegetable protein\n(soy flour,\ncaramel color),\nsalt, chili powder,\nflavoring, sugar,\nstarch, spices,\ngreen chiles,\nonions, jalapeno\npeppers.\nFrozen Fried Fish\nBalls,\nIngredients: fish\nfillet, water,\nstarch, red curry\npast, sugar, salt,\nflavor enhances,\nlime leave, egg\nwhite powder,\nphosphate\nPaneer Cheese,\nfrozen\nIngredients:\ncheese coated\nwith bread\ncrumbs\n\n2106 90\n98\n\nPaneer Bhurji\nRoll, frozen,\nfilled with\nvegetables.

While the prospects for both yield\nand quality look good in most Member States, this cannot be said of France, the EU28’s main grain\nexporter. While the early cuts of the winter grains in the southern EU28 are suggesting good yields,\ncloudy and wet weather over the last two months in France has damaged the outlook for both the size\nand quality of its grain crop. The total MY2016/17 EU28 grain crop is subsequently revised down to\njust under 312 MMT, little changed on MY2015/16 but nearly 16 MMT lower than the record set in\nMY2014/15, with the possibility of a further reduction post-harvest once the impact on the French crop\nbecomes clearer.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nUnless stated otherwise, data in this report is based on the views of Foreign Agricultural Service\nanalysts in the EU28 and is not official USDA data.\nThis report would not have been possible without the valuable expert contributions from the following\nForeign Service analysts:\nXavier Audran, FAS/Paris covering France\nOrnella Bettini, FAS/Rome covering Italy\nMila Boshnakova, FAS/Sofia covering Bulgaria\nMonica Dobrescu, FAS/Bucharest covering Romania\nDimosthenis Faniadis, FAS/Rome covering Greece\nBob Flach, FAS/The Hague covering the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden\nGellert Golya, FAS/Budapest covering Hungary\nMarta Guerrero, FAS/Madrid covering Spain and Portugal\nMira Kobuszynska, FAS/Warsaw covering Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia\nSteve Knight, FAS/London covering the United Kingdom and Ireland\nRoswitha Krautgartner, FAS/Vienna covering Austria and Slovenia\nSabine Lieberz, FAS/Berlin covering Germany\nJana Mikulasova, FAS/Prague covering the Czech Republic and Slovakia\nAndreja Misir, FAS/Zagreb covering Croatia\nYvan Polet, FAS/USEU/Brussels covering Belgium and Luxembourg\nBarrie Williams, FAS/USEU/Brussels covering policy\n\nHA = Hectares\nMT = Metric Tonne\nMY = Marketing Year. Post and USDA official data both follow the EU-28 local marketing year of\nJuly to June except for corn which follows an October to September calendar\nTY = July to June for wheat and October to September for coarse grains\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\u000cFavorable growing conditions across much of the EU28 through the spring and into early Summer have\nbeen contrasted by very wet and cloudy weather across some of the key growing regions of France since\nmid-May. As a consequence, an improved outlook for much of the EU28’s grain crop has been more\nthan offset by expectations of poor quality and a much reduced harvest in France. The wheat and barley\nharvests are now under way, albeit two weeks late in France, while the corn crop is generally reported to\nbe developing well, albeit on a reduced area year-on-year.\nAlthough the total area planted to grain crops in the EU28 is little changed year-on-year, a reduction in\nthe area planted to corn has been offset by increased plantings of both barley and rye. Similarly, a much\nimproved forecast yield for corn is offset by reduced yield of the other grains such that total production\nin MY2016/17 is now forecast to be 311.75 MMT, little changed on MY2015/16 but nearly 16 MMT\nbelow the record crop experienced in MY2014/15. Within this total, wheat production is forecast at\n154.5 MMT and barley and corn both at 62,000 MT, down 5.5 MMT, and up 700,000 MT and 2 MMT,\nrespectively, year-on-year. Of these three crops, the change is most significant for corn given the\nreduction in planted area. Rye and oats production are both forecast up around 500,000 MT year-onyear in MY2016/17 while mixed grain production is forecast up over 300,000 MT. Only sorghum\nproduction is currently forecast unchanged year-on-year. As always, much will depend on the weather\nover the coming weeks, not just for crop development but also for harvest volume. In addition, the true\nextent of the damage to the French crop is only likely to become clear at harvest.\nThe total supply of grains in the EU28 in MY2016/17 is forecast at 359.1 MMT, down around 5 MMT\nlargely due to reduced forecast corn imports. Total EU28 grains consumption is currently forecast at\nnearly 288.3 MMT in MY2016/17. Within this total, Food, Seed \u0026 Industrial (FSI) use of grains, which\nhas been following an upward trend but faltered in MY2015/16, is forecast to rise once again in\nMY2016/17, mainly due to increased year-on-year industrial use of wheat in the biofuels sector in\nPoland and the UK. Total feed use is also forecast to rise in MY2016/17, albeit below the previous\nforecast. EU wheat exports in MY2015/16 are now estimated to have reached 33.5 MMT by year end,\nbuoyed by North African demand in the latter part of the season. Following a prompt start to the\nMY2016/17 campaign, wheat exports are currently forecast to reach 30.5 MMT in MY2016/17,\ntempered somewhat by a reduction in forecast French exports. Although 3 MMT down year-on-year, if\nrealized this would still be a considerable export volume given that MY2013/14 was the first year the\nEU28 exported more than 30 MMT of wheat. The net result is a 2 MMT reduction in stocks in\nMY2016/17.\nFor rice, trade data indicate that a number of Least Developed Countries have responded to the duty\nfree/quota free access to the EU market afforded to them under the EU’s “Everything But Arms”\narrangement. In particular, EU rice imports from Cambodia, Myanmar and Guyana have increased in\nMY2014/15, supporting rising domestic consumption of rice in the EU28. Rice imports have started\nMY2015/16 strongly meaning that full year imports are again forecast to rise on a market year basis.\nCombined with a year-on-year increase in domestic production, further consumption growth is forecast.\nWith imports currently forecast to stabilize in MY2016/17, the upward trend in EU28 rice consumption\nis forecast to continue, albeit to a lesser extent than in recent years.\n\n\u000cCountry specific\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty for the French grain crop outlook - both its size and quality have\nbeen negatively impacted by excessively wet and cloudy weather since mid-May in central, northern\nand eastern France but the extent of the damage is unclear. The poor weather also means the harvest is\nrunning about two weeks behind normal. While it is a more positive story in the south west and on the\nAtlantic and Channel coasts, the affected areas report widespread lodging. The percentage of small\ngrains is also reported to be high which could lead to further losses at harvest (when grains are too\nsmall, they may pass through the combine). Additionally, fungal infestation, which could lead to higher\nmycotoxin levels, is widely reported. The French wheat crop is subsequently revised down 5 MMT on\nthe previous forecast with the possibility of a further reduction post-harvest. The reduced quality, such\nas low specific weights, problematic falling Hagberg numbers and protein problems, could present\nexport challenges. Durum wheat quality is also thought to have suffered in central France although not\nin the traditional growing regions in the south east and south west. An increase in the area planted to\ndurum means a sizeable crop is still expected but, as with soft wheat, the quality issues could have an\nimpact on export opportunities. The weather is also reported to have taken a heavy toll on the barley\ncrop and, like wheat, lodging and fungal infestation is widespread. While the forecast for barley\nproduction is reduced 750,000 MT, it is likely to remain a sizeable crop due to the large planted area.\nAgain, as with wheat, reduced quality, such as poor specific weight, is expected to reduce export\nopportunities, most notably Chinese demand for French malting barley. While the French MY2016/17\ncorn crop forecast is reduced as well, production is still forecast up year-on-year after the poor yield in\nMY2015/16.\nElsewhere in the EU28 the story is much more positive. In the UK, while no one expects a repeat of the\nlarge crops experienced in the last two years, prospects remain good, both in terms of size and quality\ndespite recent wet weather. In Germany, while parts of the country have experienced very wet weather,\nits timing is not thought to have had too detrimental effect on the grain crop and the sentiment remains\npositive.\nFurther south, in Spain, favorable spring conditions both in terms of precipitation and mild temperatures\nhave boosted winter grain yields. Indeed, if it were not for a reduction in the area planted to corn and a\nlower yield due to the use of short cycle varieties, Spain would be forecasting a record grain crop.\nWhile the quality of the grain crop is generally good, there is some concern for the durum wheat crop\ndue to Hessian fly incidence. In Portugal, favorable weather conditions are expected to result in a good\nyield for winter crops. However, spring rains and reduced crop margins are thought to have resulted in\nan historically low area planted to corn.\nIn the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia, it is a story of good weather and a positive outlook for all\ngrain crops. Further east, Romania’s wheat crop is reported to be developing extremely well. Despite\nsome heavy rains and summer storms, the crop is forecast to exceed the previous year’s level on a\nslightly increased planted area. Initial tests indicate that wheat quality is expected to be good. The\nbarley crop is also developing very well and the prospects are very positive. Finally, all currently bodes\nwell for the corn crop but with crop entering the critical phase of pollination, the focus remains on the\nweather. Moisture levels across the country have improved over the spring and summer meaning\ndevelopment conditions are currently much better than in MY2015/16. It is a similarly positive story in\nBulgaria where the outlook remains positive for all of the grain crops. With the wheat harvest well\n\n\u000cunder way and the barley harvest all but complete, quality is reported to be very good with some\nfarmers reporting record yields. The corn crop is also reported to be doing very well. Similarly,\nHungary’s corn crop is still forecast up year-on-year after the poor yield experienced in MY2014/15 and\ndespite a reduction in the planted area.\nFinally, in Greece, very favorable weather conditions are expected to result in a comparatively high\nyear-on-year yield for the durum wheat crop meaning its wheat crop is revised up 200,000 MT. As in\nsome other Member States, low corn prices and poor margins have discouraged farmers from continuing\nto increase the planted area which is now forecast unchanged from MY2015/16.\n\nAppendices\nWheat\nMarket Begin Year\nEuropean Union\n\nArea Harvested\nBeginning Stocks\nProduction\nMY Imports\nTY Imports\nTY Imp. from U.S.\nTotal Supply\nMY Exports\nTY

However, exports are not expected to recuperate at the same pace as due to\nlack of competitiveness in international markets as a result of adverse domestic factors. CY 2017 raisin exports\nare projected to remain relatively stagnant at 30,500 MT.\n\n\u000cExecutive Summary:\nRaisin production for CY 2017 is estimated at historical levels of 35,000 MT due to good weather conditions.\nRaisin exports are forecast at similar levels of CY 2016 and are estimated at 30,500 MT. However, exports are\nnot expected to fully recuperate due to decreased competitiveness by local exporters.\nRaisin producers’ primary challenge during the past few years has been the dramatic increase of production\ncosts in addition to high inflation rates and an overvalued peso, which has continued to decrease their\ncompetitiveness in export markets.\n\nCommodities:\nRaisins\nProduction:\nProduction Area\nAbout ninety-five percent of Argentine raisins are produced in the Province of San Juan, which is located\nalongside the Andes Mountains in western Argentina. The remainder is primarily produced in the Provinces of\nMendoza and La Rioja. Based on private sources’ estimates, for CY 2016 and 2017, area planted to raisin grapes\nwill remain unchanged at 6,600 hectares from CY 2015 official estimates, as no significant land investment is\nexpected in the near future since farm-gate prices have been relatively low. Flame and Fiesta are the fastestgrowing raisin grape varieties in Argentina. In addition, ninety five percent of the Flame variety is devoted to\nraisin production.\nSince the Province of San Juan is a very dry region, with an annual average rainfall of eight inches or less, all\nplantations are irrigated. The main source of water is melted snow from the Andes. Although there is still\navailable land for raisin production in the province, area expansion depends largely on irrigation, and not all\nproducers have access to irrigation due to its high cost.\nProduction\nIn CY 2017, grape production for raisins is estimated to increase to 149,000 MT, compared to the previous\ncalendar year, as a result of favorable weather conditions. In CY 2016, production is expected to decrease\nslightly from 147,500 MT in CY 2015 MT to 147,000 MT in CY 2016, due to excess rains at the end of the\nharvesting season in addition to the end of summer and beginning of autumn (the Thompson Seedless variety\nwas the most affected raisin grape variety). For CY 2017, raisin production is projected at 35,000 MT. For CY\n2016, Post adjusted production downward from USDA official estimates from 32,000 MT to 30,000 MT. For CY\n2015, raisin production was revised upward from 33,000 MT to historic levels of 43,000 MT, which included a\nraisin carry-over stock of 8,000 MT. Weather conditions were excellent during this season, which resulted in\nhigh raisin volumes of very good quality and sanitary conditions.\n\n\u000cTraditionally, there have been no significant carry-over stocks in the local raisin sector. However, Post estimates\n3,000 MT of carry-over stocks for CY 2016 and 2,500 MT for CY 2015, due large production levels.\nOne of the main challenges for the Argentine raisin sector is to increase production enough to meet\ninternational demand by improving yields and becoming more efficient. Another challenge producers currently\nface is high import tariffs established for Argentine raisins in some export markets. In addition, a major concern\nis the increase of production costs, especially of labor (accounting for about 70 percent of total production\ncosts), inputs, agrochemicals, energy, freight, and fuel, added to high inflation rates and an overvalued peso.\nThere have been private investments in the raisin sector over the past few years, primarily from domestic\ncapital. However, the investment rate has been decreasing since 2012 due to producers’ reduced profitability.\nInvestments were not only devoted to primary production (e.g. reconversion of vines), but also to the\nincorporation of new technology to obtain larger raisin volumes for processing and a higher-quality, more\ncompetitive product, to supply export markets (laser technology to improve speed, efficiency, and accuracy;\nmechanical harvesting of grapes, etc.) Moreover, private investments went to irrigation systems to optimize\nwater usage. No major investments have been announced for the near future.\nVarieties\nThe main grape varieties destined for raisins are the seedless varieties, such as Flame, which have attracted\ninvestments in processing technology and storage facilities. Other varieties are: Sultanina Blanca (Thompson\nSeedless), Superior Seedless, Torrontes Sanjuanino, Cereza, Emperador, Tinogasteña, and Criolla Chica. Fiesta is\na relatively new variety of U.S. origin, with very good yields, adaptability, and drying handling.\nThe Drying Process\nThe drying process in Argentina is carried out by over 30 companies, mainly by utilizing the sun to dry grapes.\nGrapes are laid on racks, which are located over ripieras, pieces of land covered by stones, where they are sundried for a 15 to 30-day period depending on the grape variety. The final product has a moisture content of 1520 percent. After the drying process is completed, vegetable oil is applied to raisins, which are then packed in\n30-pound cases, in bulk, or in clusters. The Argentine Ministry of Agro-Industry established a protocol for\ncertified raisins that includes Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) as part of the process.\nThe Dried-on-Vine (DOV) system is increasingly being implemented by producers as it has proved to reduce\nlabor costs by 50 percent and improve quality. Private sources estimate that, in ten years’ time, 50 percent of\nthe area planted to raisin grapes will be using DOV.\n\nConsumption:\nRaisin annual domestic consumption is very low, and it varies between 4,000 and 5,000 MT, depending largely\non production and exports. Argentines do not have the habit of eating raisins on a daily basis, such as a snack or\nin bakery products. However, new applications for raisins are increasingly being used in the local ice cream,\nbakery, and confectionery food sectors (chocolate and cereal bars). No significant increase in raisin domestic\nconsumption is expected in the near future. There are virtually no official statistics on raisin domestic\nconsumption in Argentina.\n\n\u000cBased on private source estimates, it is forecast that domestic consumption for CY 2017 and CY 2016 will remain\nstable at 5,000 MT from CY 2016 official estimates. Domestic consumption for CY 2015 was revised downward\nfrom 5,500 MT to 5,050 MT from official USDA estimates.\n\nTrade:\nCY 2017 raisin exports are projected to remain relatively stagnant at 30,500 MT from the previous calendar\nyear, despite larger production, as local exporters continue to lose competitiveness in international markets. CY\n2016 exports are forecast at 30,000 MT, up 4,500 MT from official estimates, due to larger production. CY 2015\nexports increased from the official USDA estimate of 25,500 MT to 30,000 MT, as a result of larger production.\nIn CY 2015, the main raisin export destination by volume and value was Brazil, accounting for 70 percent of total\nexports, compared to 89 percent the previous year. Exports to Brazil increased significantly by volume from\n14,500 MT to 20,800 MT, compared to CY 2014. This was due to the fact that, with a decrease in production,\nlocal exporters favored their Brazilian traditional customers in detriment of other international export markets.\nHowever, exports to that destination decreased by value by 4 percent. The second largest market for Argentine\nraisins was the U.S. with 3,700 (from 250 MT the previous year).\nArgentina’s main raisin export markets in CY 2015 were as follows:\n\nPartner Country\nWorld\nBrazil\nUnited States\nColombia\nPeru\nEU\n\nArgentina Export Statistics – Primary Destinations\nCommodity: 080620, Grapes, Dried\nCalendar Year: 2013 - 2015\n2013\n2014\nUSD\nQuantity\nUSD\nQuantity\n64,809,891\n29,047\n38,026,450\n16,276\n47,083,809\n20,433\n33,173,227\n14,455\n3,238,750\n1,567\n647,835\n250\n3,853,550\n1,816\n158,800\n94\n663,750\n273\n142,825\n56\n3,207,557\n1,294\n1,605,557\n558\n\n2015\nUSD\nQuantity\n47,898,522\n29,696\n31,808,332\n20,771\n6,568,689\n3,701\n1,657,078\n1,152\n1,724,329\n1,079\n2,674,825\n1,042\n\nSource: FAS Buenos Aires based on GTIS data\nDue to the decreasing competitiveness in international markets of Argentina’s regional economies, including the\nraisin sector, as a result of high production costs and inflation rates (estimated at over 40 percent for 2017), and\nan overvalued peso, it has become very difficult for local exporters to compete with other producing countries,\nsuch as Turkey. In addition, devaluation of local currencies in major export markets, such as Brazil, has\nworsened Argentine exporters’ competitiveness.\n\nPolicy:\nImport and Export Regulations\nDuring the past few years, the Argentine fruit sector has been greatly concerned about the numerous trade\nrestrictions and requirements affecting imports which had been instituted by the former GOA. These policies\nhampered producers in acquiring needed production and processing inputs. Other measures required preapproval for imports weeks before beginning the importation process. Additional obstacles included the\nimposition of strict limits on foreign exchange transactions and restrictions against the payment of dividends\nand repatriation of profits, more widespread usage of non-automatic import licenses, and difficulties in\nobtaining certificates of country-of-origin for products to be imported. As of the December 10, 2015, a new\n\n\u000cgovernment administration took over and all of the above measures were dropped. Producers no longer report\ndifficulties or delays in import procedures.\nIn December 2015, the new government lifted export taxes on all fruits and other commodities. Export rebates\nfor raisins remained the same at 4.05 percent and 6 percent depending on the size of the container. This policy\nchange did not have a significant impact in international markets at making Argentine agricultural commodities\nmore competitive as the export tax for raisins was low (2.5 percent).\nExport and import tariffs for raisins are as follows:\nRaisin 0806.20\nOutside the Mercosur Area\nImport Tariff\nStatistical Tax\nExport Tax\nExport Rebate: Cases containing between 2.5 kg. and 20 Kg.\nCases with 2.5 kg. or less\n\n10 %\n0.50%\n0%\n4.05%\n6.00%\n\nInside the Mercosur Area\n0.00%\n0.50%\n0%\n4.05%\n6.00%\n\nImport Tariff\nStatistical Tax\nExport Tax\nExport Rebate: Cases containing between 2.5 kg. and 20 Kg.\nCases with 2.5 kg. or less\n\nSource: FAS Buenos Aires based on data from Tarifar database\n\nMarketing:\nIn April 2015, the Province of San Juan obtained PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) certification for raisins\nand olive oil, a value-added quality guarantee.

The list consists of\nfifteen (15) antibiotics and maximum and minimum dosages allowed for use in compound feed for\nchicken, quails, pigs having weight less than 60 kg, and calves less than 6 months old.\nCircular 6/2016/TT-BNNPTNT restricts antibiotic use to a maximum of two antibiotics in one feed\nproduct. Use of more than two antibiotics in one animal feed product must be based on scientific\ndocuments. Circular 6 also regulates the use of premix in animal feed. Accordingly, only premixes\ncontaining less than 20% antibiotics are allowed to be mixed with animal feed.

Off-shore demand for New\nZealand wine is brisk. The 314 million liters of wine that should be generated from the 2016\nharvest will only just be enough to satisfy demand increases in 2016 and restore stocks to healthy\nlevels.\n\n1\n\n\u000cExecutive Summary\n\nRippon Vineyard – Wanaka South Island\n\nNew Zealand vineyards, for CY2016, have just harvested 436,000 metric tons (MT) of grapes\nsecond only to the CY2014 harvest of 445,000MT. The CY2016 harvest is 34% ahead of the\nCY2015 harvest and should produce 314 million (m) liters of wine. The CY2015 wine production\nwas 235m liters.\nAll the indications from the industry are that demand for New Zealand wine off-shore is robust.\nWineries are looking for more grapes to produce extra wine to satisfy demand. The CY2015 total\nwine supply at 270m liters was not enough to satisfy total demand of 305m liters, which reduced\nstocks at year end by 16% to 181m liters. The CY2016 harvest should mean total supply\noutweighs demand by 26m liters and stocks are restored to a healthy level of 207m liters.\nThe sector is again in a significant growth phase. The multi-national beverage companies and the\nlarge domestic wineries are planting grapes at a quicker rate than early on in the decade. The\ntotal production area reached 36,575 hectares (ha) in CY2016, two percent up on CY2015, and is\nforecast to be between 39,500ha and 40,000ha by 2020.\nExports in CY2015 reached 215m liters 21m liters ahead of CY2014. It is expected this trend will\ncontinue and CY2016 exports will be 9% up at 235m liters. Given the production area increases\nand good average grape yields exports are forecast to continue increasing by five percent per year\nup to 2020.\nImports dipped by 9% in CY2015 to 35m liters but are expected go back up to the long term\naverage of 37m liters in CY2016.\nNote: All years referred to are calendar years (CY) unless explicitly noted otherwise.\n\nVineyard \u0026 Winery production\n\n2\n\n\u000c2016\nThe total grape harvest for CY2016 was 436,000MT. This is 34% greater than the CY2015 harvest\nas a result of generally benign weather right through the growing season from spring (September\n2015) to harvest (March to April 2016). The ripening period February through April has been dry in\nthe main growing regions with warm sunny days, close to ideal. In addition the grape producing\narea is two percent up on 2015, now estimated at 36,575 ha.\nNationally this harvest is the second highest ever after the 2014 harvest of 445,000MT. Often big\nharvests are thought to make slightly lower quality wine, however some industry participants\nbelieve the 2016 vintage will be of high quality. One clue could be that because the producing area\nis five percent greater than 2014 the average yield per hectare in 2016, at 11.9MT/ha, is actually\nlower than 2014 (12.5 MT/ha). This suggests this year’s harvest is in the range of normal variation\nand will maintain New Zealand wine’s high quality reputation.\nThe CY2016 grape crush should deliver 314 million liters of wine which would make it the second\nhighest New Zealand vintage ever and 34% ahead of the CY2015 vintage.\n\nNEW ZEALAND PRODUCING VINEYARD AREA BY GRAPE VARIETY\n(Hectares)\n\nSauvignon\nBlanc\nChardonna\ny\nRiesling\nPinot Gris\nOther\nWhite\nVarieties\nSubTotal\nWhite\nArea\nPinot Noir\nMerlot\nSyrah\nCabernet\nSauvignon\nOther Red\nVarieties\nSubTotal Red\nArea\nOther \u0026\nUnknown\nTotal\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n8,860\n3,779\n\n10,49\n1\n3,918\n\n13,98\n8\n3,881\n\n16,20\n5\n3,911\n\n16,91\n0\n3,865\n\n16,75\n8\n3,823\n\n20,27\n0\n3,229\n\n20,01\n5\n3,202\n\n20,02\n9\n3,346\n\n20,26\n6\n3,361\n\n853\n762\n\n868\n1,146\n\n917\n1,383\n\n979\n1,501\n\n986\n1,763\n\n1,725\n993\n817\n\n770\n2,485\n509\n\n2,403\n787\n502\n\n2,451\n784\n535\n\n2,456\n777\n524\n\n27,26\n3\n\n26,90\n9\n\n27,14\n5\n\n27,38\n4\n\n4,803\n1,386\n299\n519\n\n5,388\n1,234\n387\n305\n\n5,488\n1,255\n408\n301\n\n5,509\n1,290\n433\n289\n\n5,564\n1,320\n435\n300\n\n392\n\n309\n\n299\n\n286\n\n291\n\n7,623\n\n7,751\n\n7,807\n\n7,910\n\n4,063\n1,420\n\n4,441\n1,447\n\n4,650\n1,383\n\n4,777\n1,369\n\n4,773\n1,371\n\n531\n\n524\n\n516\n\n517\n\n519\n\n2,348\n\n2,520\n\n2,592\n\n2,705\n\n3,241\n\n2,085\n\n449\n\n525\n\n559\n\n564\n\n22,61\n6\n\n25,35\n5\n\n29,31\n0\n\n31,96\n4\n\n33,42\n8\n\n33,60\n0\n\n35,33\n5\n\n35,18\n5\n\n35,51\n1\n\n35,85\n8\n\nSource : New Zealand Wine Growers\n\n2015\n3\n\n\u000cVineyard owners were challenged by the growing season 2014/2015 which wasn’t conducive to\nhigh yields.

This situation got\nheightened in CY2015 when the total wine supply was reduced by 25% to 270 million liters\n\n4\n\n\u000ccompared with CY2014 but demand continued to rise. At 305 million liters, demand in CY2015\nwas up six percent over CY2014. It is estimated that stocks by CY2015 year-end were 35 million\nliters (16%) down at 181 million liters.\nStocks are likely to be built back up in CY2016 to 207 million liters. Total CY2016 wine supply\nincreases to 351 million liters (30% up), which will be 26 million liters greater than forecast\ndemand now put at 325 million liters (7% up). The chief assumption for CY2016 is the level of\nexports now forecast at 235 million liters. Over the last three years exports have risen at 20\nmillion liters per year and it is expected there will be a similar increase in CY2016. Even though\nfor the year-to-date May CY2016 exports are marginally behind the same period for CY2015 it is\nexpected there will be a rapid catch up and pull ahead once the 2016 vintage of white wine is\nfermented. Export of wine in bulk will facilitate this.\nEnding CY2016 stocks are forecast to be 59% of the next year’s forecast demand, which is\ncomfortably below the 77% of next year’s demand recorded for closing stocks in CY2008 when\nthere was a real over supply.\n\nPRODUCTION TRENDS NEW ZEALAND VINEYARD AND WINE INDUSTRY\nYear Ending\nDecember\nNumber of\nWineries\nProducing Area in\nhectares\nAverage Yield\n((tons per\nhectare)\nAverage Grape\nPrice (NZ$ per\nton)\nTons Grapes\nCrushed (000's of\nTons)\nTotal Production\nWine (millions of\nliters)\n\n200\n7\n\n200\n8\n\n200\n9\n\n201\n0\n\n201\n1\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n201\n4\n\n201\n5\n\n2016\nForec\nast\n\n543\n25,3\n55\n\n585\n29,3\n10\n\n643\n31,9\n64\n\n672\n33,4\n28\n\n698\n33,4\n00\n\n703\n35,3\n35\n\n698\n35,1\n82\n\n699\n35,5\n10\n\n673\n35,8\n59\n\n675\n36,57\n5\n\n8.1\n\n9.7\n\n8.9\n\n8\n\n9.8\n\n7.6\n\n9.8\n\n12.5\n\n9.1\n\n11.9\n\n$1,9\n81\n\n$2,1\n61\n\n$1,6\n29\n\n$1,2\n93\n\n$1,2\n39\n\n$1,3\n59\n\n$1,6\n88\n\n$1,6\n66\n\n$1,7\n32\n\n$1,77\n5\n\n205\n\n285\n\n285\n\n266\n\n328\n\n269\n\n345\n\n445\n\n326\n\n436\n\n147.\n6\n\n205.\n2\n\n205.\n2\n\n190.\n0\n\n235.\n0\n\n194.\n0\n\n248.\n4\n\n320.\n4\n\n234.\n7\n\n313.9\n\nWINE CONSUMPTION AND EXPORT TRENDS FOR NEW ZEALAND\nYear Ending\nDecember\nDomestic Sales of\nNZ Wine(million\nliters)\nImports of Wine\n(millions of liters)\nTotal NZ\nDomestic\nConsumption\n\n200\n7\n\n200\n8\n\n200\n9\n\n201\n0\n\n201\n1\n\n201\n2\n\n201\n3\n\n201\n4\n\n201\n5\n\n2016\nForec\nast\n\n45.3\n\n51.2\n\n58.0\n\n62.2\n\n61.8\n\n56.7\n\n50.3\n\n54.7\n\n54.2\n\n53.0\n\n42.7\n\n38.6\n\n31.9\n\n33.2\n\n28.1\n\n34.6\n\n39.9\n\n39.0\n\n35.3\n\n37\n\n87.9\n\n89.7\n\n89.9\n\n95.4\n\n89.9\n\n91.3\n\n90.3\n\n93.7\n\n89.5\n\n90.0\n\n5\n\n\u000cPopulation\nestimate (millions)\nNZ Consumption\nper Capita of NZ\nwine(L)\nNZ Consumption\nper Capita of all\nwine(L)\nEstimated Export\nVolume (millions\nliters)\nExport\nValue(millions of\nNZ$ FOB)\nEstimated\nAverage Price\nNZD/L\nExport\nValue(millions of\n$US FOB)\nEstimated\nAverage Price\nUSD/L\nEstimated Total\nSupply\n(Production +\nImports) millions\nliters\nEstimated Total\nDemand\n(exports+\nconsumption)\nmillions liters\nInterim balance of\nSupply less\nDemand\nRunning Balance\nie estimated\nstocks at end Dec\n\n4.25\n\n4.28\n\n4.33\n\n4.37\n\n4.40\n\n4.43\n\n4.48\n\n4.55\n\n4.65\n\n4.75\n\n10.7\n\n12.0\n\n13.4\n\n14.2\n\n14.0\n\n12.8\n\n11.2\n\n12.0\n\n11.7\n\n11.2\n\n20.7\n\n21.0\n\n20.7\n\n21.8\n\n20.4\n\n20.6\n\n20.2\n\n20.6\n\n19.2\n\n18.9\n\n84.1\n\n98.7\n\n128.\n5\n\n157.\n2\n\n168.\n1\n\n176.\n6\n\n175.\n8\n\n194.\n1\n\n215.\n3\n\n235\n\n759.\n9\n\n903.\n3\n\n101\n4.0\n\n108\n8.7\n\n113\n5.0\n\n121\n6.2\n\n125\n4.9\n\n135\n1.3\n\n152\n9.8\n\n$9.0\n3\n\n$9.1\n5\n\n$7.8\n9\n\n$6.9\n3\n\n$6.7\n5\n\n$6.8\n9\n\n$7.1\n4\n\n$6.9\n6\n\n$7.1\n1\n\n560.\n1\n\n632.\n6\n\n652.\n0\n\n788.\n2\n\n900.\n8\n\n986.\n8\n\n102\n8.5\n\n111\n9.4\n\n106\n3.3\n\n$6.6\n6\n\n$6.4\n1\n\n$5.0\n7\n\n$5.0\n2\n\n$5.3\n6\n\n$5.5\n9\n\n$5.8\n5\n\n$5.7\n7\n\n$4.9\n4\n\n190.\n3\n\n243.\n8\n\n237.\n1\n\n223.\n2\n\n263.\n1\n\n228.\n6\n\n288.\n3\n\n359.\n4\n\n270.\n0\n\n350.9\n\n172.\n1\n\n188.\n4\n\n218.\n4\n\n252.\n5\n\n258.\n0\n\n267.\n9\n\n266.\n1\n\n287.\n8\n\n304.\n8\n\n325.0\n\n18.2\n\n55.3\n\n18.7\n\n29.4\n\n5.1\n\n39.3\n\n22.2\n\n71.6\n\n34.8\n\n25.9\n\n111.\n8\n\n167.\n1\n\n185.\n8\n\n156.\n4\n\n161.\n5\n\n122.\n3\n\n144.\n5\n\n216.\n0\n\n181.\n2\n\n241.9\n\nSources: NZ Wine Growers, StatisticsNZ, Global Trade Atlas, Post Estimates\nNote: For the Producing Area from 2012 on this estimate is based on October registrations by the Vineyards\n\nFuture Planting Intentions –Industry Growth projections\nOfficial NZ Winegrowers grape production area projections suggest the area will increase by two\npercent per annum from 2015 through 2018. If this is the case the producing area is likely to be\nbetween 39,500 and 40,000ha by 2020. As long as the FOB price for wine in NZ dollars remains\ngenerally the same as 2014 and 2015 (NZ$7/liter) through until 2020 a production area of\n40,000ha could produce enough wine to accomplish NZ Winegrowers’ goal of achieving NZ$2 billion\nof exports by 2020.\nThese planting intentions may turn out to be on the low side if reports coming out of Marlborough\n(the main growing region) are to be believed. In 2015 23,203ha or 65% of the total grape area\nwas planted in Marlborough. It is estimated there is somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000ha of\n\n6\n\n\u000csuitable land in the region that could still be planted. Reportedly Marlborough wine companies are\nintending to plant 6,800ha over the next five years which is approximately 3,000ha more than\nofficial estimates would have for the whole country.\nThe majority of the grape area is one variety Savignon Blanc, which in CY2015 comprised\n20,266ha or 57% of the total. Because Savignon Blanc is a high yielder compared to most of the\nother varieties grown in NZ it has an even greater dominance in the volume of grapes harvested,\nat 69% in CY2015. In a high yielding year such as 2014 it was up at 72% of the total volume.\nBearing in mind that 89% of the Savignon Blanc area is located in the Marlborough region where\nmost of the vineyard development is also located it would be safe to assume most of the grapes\nbeing planted will be Savignon Blanc. Savignon Blanc is New Zealand’s flagship wine which its\nreputation relies upon. There is certainly still growing demand for the New Zealand style of\nSavignon Blanc.\nVirtually all the new plantings now are being carried out by the multi-national beverage companies\nsuch as Constellation and Pernod Ricard and the large domestic winery businesses.\n\nResearch \u0026 Development\nA key research focus is the development of lifestyle wines: lower calorie, lower alcohol alternatives\nto traditional wine produced through new growing and production techniques. The work is being\ncarried out under the Government Primary Growth Partnership program. This project, started in\n2014, will carry on to 2022 and is co-funded by 18 industry partners and the Government. This\nwine style has been identified as an emerging category which is potentially able to contribute\nsubstantially to overall growth in wine sales.\nElsewhere there is ongoing research and extension work being carried out in the: pest and\ndiseases; reducing vineyard costs and increasing profitability; and sustainable and organic systems\nareas. An example are trials that showed that mechanical shaking plus fungicide sprays reduced\nbotrytis by 50% over sprays alone.\n\nExports, Trade, \u0026 Marketing\nExports 2016\nAs indicated earlier in the report wine exports are forecast to reach 235 million liters in CY2016,\nwhich will be nine percent ahead of the 215 million liters shipped in CY2015. If the planting\nforecasts and present prices hold, exports will continue to increase at 5.5% per year up to 2020.\nThis would put the volume of exports at between 290 to 300 million liters annually.\n\n7\n\n\u000cSource: GTA\n\nCurrent Export Destinations\nConsistently over the last three years the three top destinations (US, UK, Australia) have taken\n82% of the volume exported and provided 77% of the export receipts. For New Zealand the US\nhas now become the most valuable wine export market both by volume and value overtaking both\nthe UK and Australia after the volume of exports surged up 18% in CY2015. Primarily growth in\nthe USD8-15/bottle price category is driving sales.\nIt has been a core strategy by NZ Winegrowers for the last three years to boost sales into the US\nand Canada and this has been achieved. The industry continues to see potential for further growth\nin North America especially as the US economy looks to be stronger than the other advanced\neconomies; and the greater tourism connectivity now available between New Zealand and the US\nfamiliarizes more people with NZ wine.\nChina, the sixth most valuable market, with only NZ$28 million in FOB receipts still represents a\nlong term market opportunity.\n\nNew Zealand Wine Export Statistics by Country (HS Code 2204)\n2013\nDestination\nCountry\nUnited States\n\nFOB\nValue\nNZD\n(millio\nns)\n\nQuant\nity\n(1000'\ns\nLiters)\n\n302.7\n\n45,04\n\nFor Calendar Years 2013 - 2015\n2014\nPrice\n$/L\n\nFOB\nValue\nNZD\n(millio\nns)\n\nQuant\nity\n(1000'\ns\nLiters)\n\n$6.7\n\n343.7\n\n51,41\n\n2015\nPrice\n$/L\n\nFOB\nValue\nNZD\n(millio\nns)\n\nQuant\nity\n(1000'\ns\nLiters)\n\nPrice\n$/L\n\n$6.6\n\n432.3\n\n60,42\n\n$7.1\n\n8\n\n\u000cTotal\nUnited Kingdom\nTotal\n\n279.4\n\nAustralia Total\n\n386.7\n\n8\n47,02\n0\n53,29\n7\n\nCanada Total\n\n79.5\n\n7,416\n\nNetherlands\nTotal\n\n30.6\n\n4,571\n\nChina Total\n\n21.0\n\n1,753\n\nSingapore Total\n\n19.7\n\n1,490\n\nIreland Total\n\n16.5\n\n2,259\n\nHong Kong Total\n\n19.0\n\n1,441\n\nFrance Total\n\n9.2\n\n894\n\nJapan Total\n\n14.2\n\n1,180\n\nSweden Total\n\n13.9\n\n1,819\n\nGermany Total\n\n11.3\n\n2,066\n\nBelgium Total\n\n6.7\n\n964\n\nDenmark Total\n\n6.2\n\n824\n\nUAE Total\n\n5.0\n\n486\n\n33.4\n1,254.\n9\n\n3,314\n175,8\n42\n\nRest of the\nWorld\n\nTotal for all\nExports\n\n2\n$5.9\n4\n$7.2\n6\n$10.\n73\n$6.6\n9\n$11.\n97\n$13.\n21\n$7.3\n0\n$13.\n16\n$10.\n33\n$12.\n01\n$7.6\n7\n$5.4\n9\n$6.9\n0\n$7.5\n7\n$10.\n19\n$10.\n07\n$7.1\n4\n\n357.7\n\n9\n55,75\n0\n52,85\n1\n\n85.1\n\n8,580\n\n35.1\n\n5,304\n\n28.0\n\n1,918\n\n20.5\n\n1,560\n\n14.9\n\n2,085\n\n16.7\n\n1,387\n\n12.5\n\n1,054\n\n12.7\n\n1,163\n\n12.8\n\n1,579\n\n11.9\n\n2,148\n\n7.8\n\n1,254\n\n7.4\n\n1,032\n\n6.9\n\n630\n\n38.5\n1,351.\n2\n\n4,346\n194,0\n58\n\n339.0\n\n9\n$6.0\n8\n$6.7\n7\n$9.9\n2\n$6.6\n1\n$14.\n58\n$13.\n13\n$7.1\n7\n$12.\n04\n$11.\n91\n$10.\n95\n$8.0\n9\n$5.5\n2\n$6.2\n2\n$7.1\n6\n$11.\n03\n$8.8\n5\n$6.9\n6\n\n100.1\n\n3\n59,79\n7\n54,74\n9\n10,03\n8\n\n47.3\n\n7,566\n\n28.1\n\n1,864\n\n21.5\n\n1,597\n\n19.1\n\n2,698\n\n18.1\n\n1,338\n\n16.5\n\n1,358\n\n14.6\n\n1,189\n\n14.1\n\n1,753\n\n13.3\n\n2,668\n\n11.7\n\n2,040\n\n6.7\n\n974\n\n5.5\n\n527\n\n41.7\n1,529.\n8\n\n4,749\n215,3\n28\n\n380.0\n359.2\n\n5\n$6.3\n5\n$6.5\n6\n$9.9\n7\n$6.2\n5\n$15.\n05\n$13.\n46\n$7.0\n8\n$13.\n56\n$12.\n13\n$12.\n27\n$8.0\n6\n$5.0\n0\n$5.7\n3\n$6.9\n1\n$10.\n43\n$8.7\n8\n$7.1\n0\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\nMarketing - Distribution\nIn the international markets, most of New Zealand’s wine is generally still sold through retail\nchannels, but this is changing. The fastest growing international sales channel is online – either\ndirect, or through a third party website/distributor.\nMillennials, 18-27yr olds, have become a target demographic with online sales channels and\nlifestyle wines being key strategies to attract this age group.\nThe domestic distribution systems are more diverse. It has five key distribution channels:\nsupermarkets, liquor stores, hospitality \u0026 foodservice, cellar door and online. Of these, off-trade\n\n9\n\n\u000csales (i.e. supermarkets, liquor stores and online) account for around 80% of total sales and ontrade and cellar door sales make up the remaining 20%.\nSmaller wineries are more reliant on cellar door sales and tourism. This often involves other\nproducts/services too, such as a dining experience, special occasion entertainment (e.g. weddings)\nand accommodation in some cases. Currently 18-20% of international tourists visit wineries. Wine\ntourists spend NZ$5000/visit to NZ vs NZ$3500 for the average visitor primarily because they stay\nlonger. The top five sources of international visitors to wineries are Australia, the US, China,\nEngland, and Germany.\n\nThe Role of Bulk Wine Exports\n\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\nIn CY2015 33% of New Zealand wine exported was shipped in bulk, up from 29% in CY2014. This\namounted to 70 million liters which was 24% above the previous year’s 57 million liters. Back in\n2009 through 2011 discounted wine was exported in bulk to clear excess stocks. However that\npractice has declined in favor of the large wineries exporting a proportion of their wine in bulk,\nwhich will be sold under their premium brands/labels, and bottling in the destination country to\ntake advantage of cheaper bottling costs.\n\nGovernment Policy\nIn April 2015 the Government announced that it will implement the Geographical Indicators\nRegistration Act. The chair of NZ Winegrowers, Steve Green, said this was the biggest project the\norganization was currently handling. The proposed legislation will give protection to the brands,\nonce registered, that are tied to distinct geographical regions such as “Marlborough Savignon\nBlanc”. The Geographical Indications (Wine and Spirits) Registration Amendment Bill has passed\nits first reading in Parliament and was referred to the Primary Production Select Committee for\nconsideration and submissions. The Select Committee is due to report back by September 17,\n2016. It is not known whether the Bill will make it into law this year or sometime next year.\nIn the future once the supply of Savignon Blanc from the Marlborough region becomes limited\nbecause there is very little land left to plant having a registered Geographical Indication will help\nstop other labels falsely claiming their wine is Marlborough sourced and perhaps add a premium to\nthe registered Marlborough wine.\n\n10\n\n\u000cMarket Access\nTrans Pacific Partnership (TPP) – Trade Agreement\nAfter seven years of negotiations the 12 Pacific rim countries: US, Canada, Japan, Mexico,\nMalaysia, Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, and NZ concluded an agreement on\ntrade, services, investment, and labor in October 2015 which was signed in February 2016.\nImplementation is still waiting on all countries to ratify, most notably the US has still to ratify.\nAmong the TPP members all tariffs on wines will be eliminated either at entry into force or over a\nperiod of three to fifteen years.\nAt entry into force of the TPP New Zealand will gain:\n tariff-free access to the US for bottled still wine;\n tariff-free access to Canada for all wine;\n tariff-free access to Peru for bottled still wine; and\n tariff-free access to Mexico for sparkling wine.\nIn addition there will phased elimination of tariffs for:\n bulk wine entering the US over three years and over five years for all other wine;\n entry into Mexico over three years for all other wines not covered at entry into force;\n entry into Peru for all wines over five years;\n Japan, a 33% tariff cut at entry into force and total elimination after seven years; and\n Malaysia and Viet Nam after 15 years.\n\nKorea FTA\nAfter nine formal rounds of negotiations which commenced in 2009, South Korea and New Zealand\n(NZ) concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement in November, 2014. The agreement was\nratified and came into force on December 20, 2015.\nThe New Zealand wine sector has fared well under this agreement. Currently total NZ wine exports\nto South Korea are relatively small, at approximately NZ$1.9 million per year. The 15% tariff on\nNZ wine exports were eliminated when the FTA came into force.\n\nEU \u0026 Britain\nPrior to the “Brexit” referendum the E.U. had agreed to start the process for Free Trade\nnegotiations with New Zealand. However with Britain now intending to leave the E.U it may mean\nNew Zealand will negotiate on two fronts aiming to achieve FTA’s with both Britain and the E.U.\n\nImports\nTotal wine imports to New Zealand for CY2015 were 35.3m liters, 9% down on CY2014. Brisk\ndemand for New Zealand wines off-shore means the wineries won’t be as tempted to discount their\nproduct domestically to increase sales leaving the way open for an increase in imported wine to fill\n\n11\n\n\u000cthe demand gap. It is expected imports in CY2016 will go back up to the long run average of 37m\nliters per annum.\n\nNew Zealand Wine Import Statistics by Country of Origin\nFor Calendar Years showing Value in USD and Quantity in Liter Equivalents\n2013\nOrigin\nCountry\n\nAustralia\nTotal\nFrance Total\nItaly Total\nSouth Africa\nTotal\nSpain Total\nChile Total\nNew Zealand\nTotal\nUnited\nStates Total\nPortugal\nTotal\nArgentina\nTotal\nAll Other\nOrigins\nTotal\nImports\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nValue\nfor Duty\nin USD\n\nQuanti\nty (L)\n\nPric\ne/L\n\nValue\nfor Duty\nin USD\n\nQuanti\nty (L)\n\nPric\ne/L\n\nValue\nfor Duty\nin USD\n\nQuanti\nty (L)\n\nPric\ne/L\n\n71,699,\n766\n35,271,\n903\n4,538,9\n70\n\n31,052,\n265\n2,059,8\n20\n868,43\n8\n\n$2.3\n1\n$17.\n12\n$5.2\n3\n\n66,955,\n226\n41,081,\n933\n5,620,9\n27\n\n29,129,\n950\n2,385,9\n02\n1,081,3\n84\n\n$2.3\n0\n$17.\n22\n$5.2\n0\n\n56,768,\n651\n40,048,\n418\n4,953,7\n66\n\n27,040,\n856\n2,567,0\n68\n1,171,1\n58\n\n$2.1\n0\n$15.\n60\n$4.2\n3\n\n5,969,0\n92\n2,118,2\n46\n2,558,4\n61\n\n2,186,6\n09\n513,40\n1\n1,948,6\n27\n\n$2.7\n3\n$4.1\n3\n$1.3\n1\n\n5,093,6\n94\n2,784,7\n35\n2,397,8\n47\n\n1,884,0\n64\n699,87\n0\n2,054,5\n14\n\n$2.7\n0\n$3.9\n8\n$1.1\n7\n\n2,537,1\n22\n2,377,9\n80\n1,945,0\n26\n\n1,182,3\n52\n633,17\n5\n1,660,4\n50\n\n$2.1\n5\n$3.7\n6\n$1.1\n7\n\n1,219,9\n78\n\n738,27\n6\n\n$1.6\n5\n\n1,549,5\n08\n\n887,05\n7\n\n$1.7\n5\n\n1,411,2\n42\n\n258,76\n5\n\n$5.4\n5\n\n563,178\n\n68,638\n\n$8.2\n1\n\n915,367\n\n127,18\n8\n\n$7.2\n0\n\n1,386,9\n80\n\n164,06\n6\n\n$8.4\n5\n\n1,064,9\n81\n\n187,80\n4\n\n$5.6\n7\n\n1,407,0\n66\n\n279,83\n6\n\n$5.0\n3\n\n1,119,5\n46\n\n245,76\n8\n\n$4.5\n6\n\n595,511\n\n137,35\n5\n\n$4.3\n4\n\n1,014,6\n83\n\n254,78\n6\n\n$3.9\n8\n\n811,000\n\n194,32\n3\n\n$4.1\n7\n\n780,971\n\n154,60\n3\n\n$5.0\n5\n\n1,014,8\n79\n\n187,91\n6\n\n$5.4\n0\n\n873,122\n\n170,04\n9\n\n$5.1\n3\n\n126,381\n,057\n\n39,915,\n836\n\n$3.1\n7\n\n129,835\n,865\n\n38,972,\n467\n\n$3.3\n3\n\n114,232\n,853\n\n35,288,\n031\n\n$3.2\n4\n\nSource: GTA\n\nNew Zealand Wine Import Analysis\nby Calendar Year for Quantity in Liters and Average Price in USD/Liter\n2013\n2014\nDescription\n\nQuantity\n\nAv\nPrice/L\n\nQuantity\n\nAv\nPrice/L\n\n2015\n\nQuantity\n\nAv\nPrice/L\n\nSub Total Fortified Wine in\nbulk\nSub Total Fortified Wine\nbottled\n\n25,002\n\n$1.94\n\n10,663\n\n$7.56\n\n51,724\n\n$1.28\n\n396,666\n\n$5.26\n\n434,360\n\n$5.20\n\n439,782\n\n$4.44\n\nTotal Fortified Wine\n\n421,668\n\n$5.06\n\n445,022\n\n$5.26\n\n491,506\n\n$4.11\n\nSub Total Red in bulk\n\n7,533,508\n\n$1.16\n\n8,958,857\n\n$1.05\n\n6,831,938\n\n$0.80\n\nSub Total Red bottled\n\n11,993,666\n\n$4.84\n\n12,172,978\n\n$4.80\n\n12,105,898\n\n$4.18\n\n12\n\n\u000cTotal Red Wine\n\n19,527,174\n\n$3.42\n\n21,131,835\n\n$3.21\n\n18,937,836\n\n$2.96\n\n266\n\n$3.68\n\nSub Total Sparkling Wine in\nbulk\nSub Total Sparkling Wine\nbottled\n\n2,923,718\n\n$11.64\n\n2,847,951\n\n$13.85\n\n3,693,096\n\n$10.86\n\nTotal for Sparkling Wine\n\n2,923,718\n\n$11.64\n\n2,847,951\n\n$13.85\n\n3,693,362\n\n$10.86\n\nSub Total White in bulk\n\n13,423,531\n\n$0.75\n\n11,310,323\n\n$0.69\n\n9,251,065\n\n$0.60\n\nSub Total White bottled\n\n3,619,745\n\n$3.71\n\n3,237,336\n\n$3.82\n\n2,914,262\n\n$3.61\n\nTotal White Wine\n\n17,043,276\n\n$1.37\n\n14,547,659\n\n$1.39\n\n12,165,327\n\n$1.32\n\nSub Total All Wine in Bulk\n\n20,982,041\n\n$0.90\n\n20,279,843\n\n$0.85\n\n16,134,993\n\n$0.69\n\nSub Total All Wine Bottled\n\n18,933,795\n\n$5.68\n\n18,692,625\n\n$6.02\n\n19,153,038\n\n$5.39\n\nTotal For All Wine\n\n39,915,836\n\n$3.17\n\n38,972,467\n\n$3.33\n\n35,288,031\n\n$3.24\n\nSource: GTA\n\nImporting Regulations\nPolicy Settings\nThe new “Sale and Supply of Liquor Act” came into being during 2013. For most wine sellers and\nwinery cellar door operations there will be no change and the fees payable to operate will remain\nthe same.\nThe Government of New Zealand has indicated it is starting a review of the “Customs and Excise\nAct” however there are no definite timelines as to when this will happen. Excise tax is applied to\nall wine produced and sold in NZ so any changes may affect wine sellers costs sometime in the\nfuture.\n\nComposition and Labeling Requirements\nAll wine sold in New Zealand, including imported wine, must meet the labeling and composition\nrequirements set out in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, commonly referred to as\n“the Code”. (Click here for information on the code:\nhttp://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodstandards/foodstandardscode/)\nIn addition to the regulations in the Code, New Zealand has rules for grape wine label statements\nabout variety, vintage, or country or area of origin. These rules are collectively known as the “85%\nrule”. If a label states the wine is from a particular grape variety, vintage, or area, then at least\n85% of that wine must be from that variety, vintage or area. The 85% rule applies to wine labeled\nfor retail sale. It does not apply to wine sold in bulk. As statements about grape variety, vintage\nor area of origin are not mandatory on a wine label in New Zealand, any label that does not have\nthis information is not subject to the 85% rule.\nWhile there are no specific requirements for information that goes on front or back wine labels in\nNew Zealand, front labels tend to be reasonably simple. They typically contain the name of the\nwinery, the region, the varietal, and the vintage year. This universal approach affords New\nZealand’s export-oriented wine sector with the flexibility and cost-advantage of printing up back\nlabels with the specific information required by the competent authority in New Zealand’s many\nexport markets.\n\n13\n\n\u000cNew Zealand and the United States have an agreement in place that recognizes the respective\nwine making practices of the two countries. However, there are some differences in labeling\nrequirements. For instance, New Zealand regulations require specific information on the label\nregarding how many “standard drinks” are contained in the wine bottle. There is also a\nrequirement for allergen labeling, which does not exist in the United States. (For instance, if the\nwine was fined with egg whites, that must be printed on the label.) New Zealand also requires the\n“supplier” to be printed on the label, which could be the manufacturer, importer or distributor.\n(Most exporting companies tend to put the name of the importer on the back label.) Unlike the\nUnited States, New Zealand does not require a government health warning on the label.\nFor a list of composition and labeling requirements, please see Appendix II of this report.\n\nTariffs and Taxes\nDescription\n\nHS\nCode\n\nTariff as of January\n2011\n\nSparkling Wine\n\n2204.10\n\n5%\n\nWine of Fresh Grapes\n\n2204.10\n\n5%\n\nWine for Further\nManufacture\n\n2204.29\n\n5%\n\nExcise\nEquivalent\n$2.8438 per liter\n$2.8438 per liter\n$0\n\nHPA Levy*\n3.8043 cents per\nliter\n3.8043 cents per\nliter\n3.8043 cents per\nliter\n\nSource: New Zealand Customs Working Tariff Document\nhttp://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/tariff/theworkingtariffdocument/Documents/Section%20IV.pdf\nNote: The excise equivalent for imports is equal to the tax levied on domestically produced wine. Taxes listed here are a\nguide only. See Appendix II for the New Zealand Customs website. Product for further manufacture has an excise tax\nplaced on it when the final product is sold to retailers.\n* Health Promotion Levy (HPA) has superseded the Alcoholic and Liquor Advisory Council (ALAC) Levy\n\nExcise Equivalent: The excise equivalent is charged to the importer or wholesaler when the\nproduct is sold to the retailer. Imported product that is moved to a licensed manufacturing area\nfor further manufacture is not assessed the excise tax until after the manufacturing process is\ncompleted and it is sold to the retailer in a consumer packaged form.\nGoods and Services Tax (GST): With few exceptions, goods imported and sold in New Zealand\nare liable for a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 15%. GST is payable on the sum of the Customs\nvalue of the goods, the import duty, the ALAC levy, and freight and insurance costs.\nIndicative Fees and Charges: An import transaction fee of NZ$25.30 is payable on every import\nentry and import declaration for goods. A biosecurity risk screening levy of $12.77 is also collected\nby Customs on behalf of MPI Biosecurity New Zealand.\nThere would also usually be a multiple release permit (MRP) form to be completed, which has a fee\nof $210.45, in order to commence imports.\n\nAppendix I.

Mandatory Requirements for Wine Imported into New\nZealand\nMANDATORY REQUIREMENTS (Standards 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.5, 1.2.9, 2.7.1)\nThe following requirements apply to all wine for sale in New Zealand. Different requirements may apply in export markets.\nAny mandatory items must be set out legibly and prominently such as to afford a distinct contrast to the background,\nLegibility (Standard 1.2.9)\nand in the English language.\nAll wine must bear a name or description sufficient to indicate the true nature of the food (e.g. “sparkling wine”,\nName of Food (Standard\n“white wine” etc., a grape variety name, or a generic name such as Port).\n1.2.2)\nAll wine must bear lot identification on the package. If there is just one bottling of a particular wine then there is no\nLot identification (Standard\nneed for a separate lot number, as the lot is self-defined.\n1.2.2)\nAll wine must bear the name and business address in New Zealand or Australia of the supplier. The “supplier” may\nName and address of\nbe the producing winery, packer, vendor or importer. The address should be a physical address.\nsupplier (Standard 1.2.2)\nAll wine must bear an alcohol declaration. The acceptable form for the declaration is ‘million liters/100g’ or ‘million\nAlcohol declaration\nliters/100 million liters’ or ‘x% alcohol by volume’ or words or expressions of the same or similar meaning – i.e. “%\n(Standard 2.7.1)\nvol” will suffice. Tolerances of the declared alcohol content from that actual alcohol content are: fortified wine: + or\n– 0.5%; wine and sparkling wine: + or – 1.5%\nAll wine must bear a statement of net contents (e.g. 750million liters).\nNet contents (Weights and\nmeasures regulations 1999\nand amendments)\nAll wine must bear a standard drink declaration The form of the standard drink statement is: “contains approx. x.x\nStandard drinks (Standard\nstandard drinks”. The formula for calculating the number of standard drinks is: 0.789 x the actual alcohol content x\n2.7.1)\nthe volume of the container (in liters).\nAll wine must bear a country of origin declaration (e.g. “New Zealand wine”, “Product of New Zealand”). This is\nCountry of Origin (Wine\nessentially a 100% standard – if any of the grapes, grape juice, concentrated grape juice or spirit used in a wine\nRegulations 2006 Reg#7)\noriginates in another country, then that must also be included on the label\nDate labelling is not required for bottled wine, but may be for wines with a shorter shelf life, such as bag-in-box.\nDate of Labelling (Standard\n1.2.5)\nAll wine must bear a sulphite declaration if it contains more than 10 mg/kg of sulphur dioxide. The form of the\nAllergens (Standard 1.2.3\nstatement is: “contains preservative 220” (or 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 228), “contains sulphites”, or “contains sulphur\ndioxide”.\nA wine label must include an allergen declaration if egg, fish or milk products are present. Isinglass is now exempt\nfrom allergen labelling, although other fish collagen products still need to be declared.\nWines are prohibited from bearing health claims, or making representations as to being low in alcohol or nonProhibited Labelling on\nintoxicating etc.\nWine (Standard 2.7.1 and\n1.1.A.2)\nGRAPE VARIETY, VINTAGE AND AREA OF ORIGIN (Wine (Specifications) Notice) 2006)\nStatements about grape variety, vintage or area of origin are not mandatory on a wine label. When they are used on wines made from 2007 onwards all\nwines must comply with these rules whether they are destined for export or not. The only exception is when an overseas market has a less strict\nrequirement and the NZFSA has given specific permission for exporters to use the less strict requirement applying in that market, as is currently the case\nfor the USA.\nA label that states the wine is a single grape variety, vintage or area must be at least 85% from the stated variety, vintage or area. For example a ‘2007’\nwine must contain at least 85% of vintage 2007 wine.\nA label that states the wine is a blend of grape varieties, vintages or areas, at least 85% of the blend must be from the stated varieties, vintages or areas. For\nexample ‘Chardonnay Chenin Blanc’ must contain at least 85% from Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc grapes.\nA label that states the wine is a combination of grape variety, vintage, and area of origin, the combination must be at least 85% of that wine. For example\n‘2008 Marlborough Pinot Noir’ must contain a minimum of 85% Pinot Noir from Marlborough that was harvested in 2008.\nA label that states more than one grape variety, vintage, or area, must present that information in descending order from the greatest to the least proportion\nin the blend. For example ‘Chardonnay Chenin Blanc’ must contain more Chardonnay than Chenin Blanc in the blend.\nA label must not include a claim about grape variety, vintage or area if that wine contains a greater percentage of wine from another grape variety, vintage\nor area that is not referred to by that label. For example a wine that contains 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Pinotage and 10% Merlot could be referred to\nas a ‘Cabernet Pinotage’ or a ‘Cabernet Pinotage Merlot’ but not a ‘Cabernet Merlot’.\nCultures of micro-organisms used to make wine may be excluded from the minimum content calculations (up to a maximum of 50million liters/L) as can\nbrandy or other spirit used for fortifying wine.\nWines made from the 2006 and earlier vintages are exempt from the 85% rules, but remain subject to the current 75% requirement for statements about\ngrape variety and the Fair Trading Act. If a blended wine contains more than 50% wine from the 2006 vintage or earlier, and that wine is blended before 1\nJuly 2008, then the old rules continue to apply.\nSource: New Zealand Winegrowers\n\n16\n\n\u000c","similarList":"New Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nRaisin Annual_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-29-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nRaisin Annual_Ankara_Turkey_7-28-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nStone Fruit Report 2016_Berlin_Germany_7-21-2016.txt\nRaisin Annual_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual 2016_Prague_Czech Republic_5-10-2016.txt\nStrong Results at Vinexpo Hong Kong 2016 for U.S. Wines_Hong Kong_Hong Kong_7-20-2016.txt\nBiofuels Annual_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-21-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\n","title":"New Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt","summary":"PRODUCTION TRENDS NEW ZEALAND VINEYARD AND WINE INDUSTRY\nAs indicated earlier in the report wine exports are forecast to reach 235 million liters in CY2016,\nTotal wine imports to New Zealand for CY2015 were 35.3m liters, 9% down on CY2014.\nIn addition to the regulations in the Code, New Zealand has rules for grape wine label statements\nIf a label states the wine is from a particular grape variety, vintage, or area, then at least\nwine was fined with egg whites, that must be printed on the label.)

For major crops FAS/Moscow forecasts: 65 MMT of wheat, 17.5 MMT of barley, 13.5\nMMT of corn, 2.5 MMT of rye, 4.5 MMT of oats, 0.72 MMT of milled rice, or 1.1 MMT in rough\nweight, and almost 3.6 MMT of other grains and pulses. FAS/Moscow forecasts grain exports in MY\n2016/17 at 33.2 MMT, 4 percent lower than the record 34.5 MMT’s exported in MY 2015/16, but the\nsecond highest exports in Russian history. The export forecast includes 24.5 MMT of wheat, 3.8 MMT\nof barley, 4.1 MMT of corn, and approximately 0.7 MMT of other grains and pulses.\n\n\u000cPost:\nMoscow\n\nCommodities:\nWheat\nBarley\nCorn\nRye\nOats\nRice, Milled\nMillet\n\nGeneral Information\nNOTE: USDA unofficial data excludes Crimean production and exports. However, as of June\n2014, Russian official statistics (ROSSTAT) began incorporating Crimean production and trade\ndata into their official estimates. Where possible, data reported by FAS Moscow is exclusive of\ninformation attributable to Crimea.\n\nExecutive Summary\nFAS/Moscow increased its April 2016 grain production forecast by 7 MMT to 107.7 MMT. This is a\nfour percent increase from the 2015 crop, and nearly meets Russia’s record grain crop of 108.2 MMT in\n2008. The increased forecast is based on: area planted with winter grain this year is higher than last\nyear; the winter grains are in very good condition, especially wheat; and so far the weather conditions\nhave been favorable for the winter grains harvest. By major crops FAS/Moscow forecasts: 65 MMT of\nwheat (the same as USDA’s official forecast), 17.5 MMT of barley (the forecast is 0.5 MMT lower than\nthe USDA official forecast), 13.5 MMT of corn (also 0.5 MMT lower than the official USDA forecast),\n2.5 MMT of rye and 4.5 MMT of oats (both forecasts match USDA official forecast), 0.72 MMT of\nmilled rice, or 1.1 MMT in rough weight (almost the same as USDA official forecast), and almost 3.6\nMMT of other grains and pulses.\nFAS/Moscow increased its forecast compared with the previous forecast made in April 2015, based on\nthe following factors:\n-\n\n1\n\nThe winter grain survival area this year is larger than last year, and winter damage to grain is\nlower than last year. The official data on the survival of winter grains in all of Russia, and by\nfederal districts, is not yet available. However, official data for agricultural enterprises (from\nRussian State Statistical Service (Rosstat)), which comprise almost half of all Russian grain\nproducers, report that as of June 1, 2016, winter kill of grains was 2.6 percent of the winter grain\narea planted at agricultural enterprises. Last year at the same time, the winter kill was reported\nas 8.7 percent of the winter grain area at agricultural enterprises1. Winter grain kill on other\nfarms is usually higher than that experienced by agricultural enterprises. However, industry\nanalysts report that the situation this year with winter grain is better than last year, and most of\nthe winter grain that was in poor condition at the beginning of spring 2016 recovered later in the\nspring. The total winter grain area, in June 2016 at the eve of the beginning of harvest, was 1 to\n2 percent larger than winter grain area for the 2015 crop, which were approximately 15.0 million\n\nhttp://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/B09_03/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d06/117sev17.htm\n\n\u000c-\n\n-\n\nhectares;\nThe weather conditions for the spring grain sowing campaign were generally favorable, and as of\nJune 21, 2016, the area sown to spring grains, according to the Ministry of Agriculture (MinAg)\nwas 30.83 million hectares. This is 178,000 HA, or 0.6 percent less than last year and includes\n13.64 million hectares sown to spring wheat (255,000 hectares more than in 2015), 7.76 million\nhectares sown to spring barley (484,000 hectares less than last year), almost 2.81 million\nhectares sown to corn for grain (82,000 hectares more than last year), and 6.62 million hectares\nsown to other grain crops (minus 31,000 hectares from last year). Industry analysts report that in\nsome provinces farmers were still sowing until the end of June. Therefore, the data may be\ncorrected upward. Industry analysts estimate that the total spring grain area may reach 31\nmillion hectares, including 13.7 million hectares of spring wheat2;\nWeather conditions for harvesting winter grains and for sowing of late spring grain crops were\nfavorable in Central European Russia and in the Volga Valley. Harvest began at least one week\nearlier than last year. With the increased area and the good condition of winter crops, especially\nwinter wheat, the winter crop production may be larger than last year.\n\nFAS/Moscow forecasts that the wheat harvested area will be 26 million hectares, barley harvested area\nwill be 8.1 million hectares, and corn harvested area will be 2.9 million hectares.\nIndustry analysts estimate that the total grain harvested area in Russia will be approximately 46.7\nmillion hectares (0.1 percent more than in 2015), including 26.68 million hectares under wheat (winter\nand spring), 8.67 million hectares of barley, 3.03 million hectares of corn and 8.32 million hectares of\nother grains and pulses3.\nFAS/Moscow forecasts grain exports in MY 2016/17 at 33.2 MMT, 4 percent lower than the record 34.5\nMMTs exported in MY 2015/16, but the second highest export total in Russian history. The export\nforecast includes 24.5 MMT of wheat, 3.8 MMT of barley, 4.1 MMT of corn, and approximately 0.7\nMMT of other grains and pulses. Wheat comprises the major portion of grain exports. These forecasts\nby crops are slightly lower than the official USDA forecast. Despite the expected bumper crop, Russian\ngrain, especially wheat, may become less competitive in world markets for several reasons: decreasing\nworld wheat prices vs stabilization of ruble exchange rate, regulatory policies of the Russian\ngovernment, such as the “floating” export duty on wheat, and permanent phytosanitary checks of all\nsegments of the domestic grain chain. These factors may influence wheat trade and the volume of wheat\nexports, as well as other grains. The FAS/Moscow forecast is based on the assumption that there will be\nno drastic changes in Russian government policy, or in the Ruble to U.S. Dollar exchange rate.\nAssuming grain exports at 33.2 MMT, FAS/Moscow forecasts feed consumption of grain at almost 38\nMMT, nearly a 2 MMT increase from the MY 2015/16, and food, seed and industrial consumption of\ngrain at 35 MMT, the same as last year. The increase in feed grain consumption is based on several\nassumptions: the development of the Russian poultry and livestock sectors will continue, and demand\n\n2\n\nSource: industry analysts’ estimate and preliminary data of the Ministry of Agriculture.\nThese data include Crimea, which is approximately 0.5 million hectares of grain, including 274,000 hectares of wheat,\n197,000 hectares of barley, and 32,000 hectares of other grains.\n3\n\n\u000cfor feeds will be strong; domestic grain prices will decrease; and sources of protein in feed rations\n(especially soybean meal) will be less available or will be very expensive4. Thus, some poultry and\nlivestock producers may increase the ratio of grain in feeding rations, even at the expense of feeding\nefficiency.\nProduction\nFAS/Moscow forecasts Russia’s total grain production at 107.7 MMT, including 65 MMT of wheat (the\nsame as the official USDA forecast), 17.5 MMT of barley (0.5 MMT lower than the USDA official\nforecast), 13.5 MMT of corn (0.5 MMT lower than the official USDA forecast), 2.5 MMT of rye and 4.5\nMMT of oats (both forecasts match the USDA official forecast), 0.72 MMT of milled rice, or 1.1 MMT\nin rough weight (almost the same as the USDA official forecast), and almost 3.6 MMT of other grains\nand pulses.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture’s grain production forecast remains at 106 MMT, with the potential to reach\n110 MMT. Industry analysts’ forecasts vary from 108 MMT to 111 MMT.\nFAS/Moscow forecasts that the wheat harvested area will be 26 million hectares, the barley harvested\narea will be 8.1 million hectares, and the corn harvested area will be 2.9 million hectares. The Russian\nMinistry of Agriculture estimates the total planned harvest area for grains (winter and spring) and pulses\nat 46.8 million hectares. This area includes 27.3 million hectares of wheat, 8.23 million hectares of\nbarley, and 11.25 million hectares of other grains and pulses5. Industry analysts estimate the total grain\nharvested area in Russia will be approximately 46.7 million hectares (0.1 percent more than in 2015),\nincluding 26.68 million hectares under wheat (winter and spring), 8.67 million hectares of barley, 3.03\nmillion hectares of corn and 8.32 million hectares of other grains and pulses6. Industry analysts estimate\nthe total harvested grain area at 46.7 million hectares (with Crimea), including 26.7 million hectares of\nwheat (winter and spring), almost 8.7 million hectares of barley, and 11.35 million hectares of other\ngrains and pulses7.\nSpring grain area\nBy the end of June, Russia completed sowing spring grains. The Ministry of Agriculture’s last report on\nspring grain sowing, by provinces and by major crops, was released on June 21, 2015. According to this\nreport, spring grains were sown on 30.08 million hectares, while in 2015. 31.0 million hectares8 were\nsown to spring grains (Chart 1). The Siberia and the Volga Valley federal districts are two major spring\ngrain producing areas, and most of this area was sown to spring wheat. The spring grain area, according\nto the Ministry of Agriculture’s data, decreased slightly in the major crop producing districts of the\nRussian Federation: South, Volga Valley and Siberia federal districts (Chart 1). In Siberia data may be\ncorrected, because sowing in that region may continue till the end of June. As for the South and the\nVolga Valley federal districts, some decrease in spring grain area may be caused by tight competition\n4\n\nRussian imports of soybeans and soybean meal, which cover over half of domestic demand in soybeans/soybean meal, may\ndecrease due to the ban on imports of U.S. soybeans for crushing and tight requirements for registration (even in the absence\nof registration mechanisms) of grains, oilseeds and feeds that are produced from or with the use of GE organisms.\n5\nThis data do not include Crimea, where, according to MinAg, planned 2016 harvest area is estimated at 0.5 million hectares,\nincluding 0.27 million hectares of wheat, 0.2 million hectares of barley and 0.03 million hectares of other grains and pulses)\n6\nThese data include Crimea, which is approximately 0.5 million hectares of grain, including 274,000 hectares of wheat,\n197,000 hectares of barley, and 32,000 hectares of other grains.\n7\nProZerno presentation at Grain Round Gelendjik.\n8\nFAS/Moscow does not count Crimea.\n\n\u000cfor land with oilseeds and other crops. The total area sown to spring wheat in Russia increased by 1.9\npercent to 13.64 million hectares, the area sown to corn for grain increased by 3 percent to 2.81 million\nhectares, while the area sown to spring barley and other grains decreased by 5.9 percent to 7.76 million\nhectares and by 0.5 percent to 6.62 million hectares, respectively (Chart 2).\n\nSource: FAS/Moscow based on Russian Ministry of Agriculture’s data.\n\nSource: Russian Ministry of Agriculture\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, economic factors for spring sowing and for treatment of\n\n\u000cwinter crops were better in 2016 than a year ago. Farmers have larger stocks of fertilizer and received\nmore commercial loans with subsidized interest rates than a year ago. According to the Ministry of\nAgriculture, from January 1 through July 11, 2016 agricultural producers purchased 1.7 MMT of\nmineral fertilizer (active ingredient), which is 145,300 MT (9 percent) more than in the same period in\n2015, despite increased prices for those inputs. The accumulated stocks of mineral fertilizer (including\ncarry-over from CY 2015) are 2 MMT, 173,000 MT more than on July 11, 2015. However, these stocks\nare 0.6 MMT less than the estimated “need” of farmers for 2016 seasonal field works. As of July 11,\n2016, the average price of ammonia nitrate was 14,899 rubles per 1MT (+2 percent y-o-y), the price of\ncarbamide was19,202 rubles per 1MT (+0.1 y-o-y), the price of potassium chloride was 15,393 rubles\nper 1 MT (+25 percent), the price of azophosks (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizer) was 22,908\nrubles per 1 MT (+11 percent), and the price of ammophos (ammonium-phosphate fertilizer) was 31,010\nrubles (+29 percent y-o-y)9.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture monitors loans issued to farmers by state owned banks. These loans usually\nget interest rate subsidies from the federal budget. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the\nportfolio of commercial short-term loans for financing 2016 seasonal field works reached 158.11 billion\nrubles by July 14, 2016. This is 22.2 percent more than on the same date last year. These loans include\n103.31 billion ruble loans from “Rosselkhozbank” (25.4 percent more than last year), and 54.8 billion\nruble loans issued by “Sberbank” (16.7 percent more than last year)10.\nHarvest Progress\nThe harvest in Russia started in the middle of June, almost a week earlier than last year. By July 20,\n2016, Russian farmers harvested 30.24 MMT of grain, including 24.45 MMT of wheat and 2.86 MMT\nof barley. On the same data in 2015, the harvest totaled only 22.62 MMT of grain, including 17.99\nMMT of wheat and 2.27 MT of barley. The grain harvested area exceeds the area harvested on the same\ndate in 2015. And, in spite of the fast progress of harvesting, yields this year are higher than the yields\nlast year, particularly wheat yields. In the Southern federal district, farmers harvested 50 percent of the\ngrain area planned for harvest, and in the North Caucasus federal district, farmers harvested 59 percent\nof the grain area. The harvest in the Central and Volga Valley federal districts started with only 8.3 and\n6.1 percent of the grain area harvested by July 20, 2016, respectively. The Ural, Siberia and the Far East\nof Russia are still two to three weeks from starting their grain harvest.\n\n9\n\nhttp://www.mcx.ru/news/news/show/52601.355.htm\nhttp://www.mcx.ru/news/news/show/52803.355.htm\n\n10\n\n\u000cSource: FAS/Moscow based on Ministry of Agriculture’s Daily data\n\nSource: FAS/Moscow based on Ministry of Agriculture’s Daily data\n\n\u000cSource: FAS/Moscow based on Ministry of Agriculture’s Daily data\nTrade\nFAS/Moscow forecasts Russia’s total grain exports in MY 2016/17 at 33.2 MMT. This forecast\nincludes the following:\n- 24.5 MMT of wheat (including flour in grain equivalent), which is 0.5 MMT lower than wheat\nexports in MY 2015/16, but still the second highest wheat exports in Russian history. This\nforecast is 0.5 MMT lower than official USDA forecast. Despite an expected bumper wheat\ncrop, Russian wheat may be less competitive in the world markets: world wheat prices are\ndecreasing, the Russian ruble has stabilized, regulatory policies of the Russian government, such\nas the “floating” export duty on wheat, and permanent phytosanitary checks of all segments of\nthe domestic grain chain, may seriously influence wheat trade. Meanwhile, the FAS/Moscow\nforecast is based on the assumption that there will be no drastic changes in government policies\nor in the ruble exchange rate.\n- 3.8 MMT of barley, 0.5 MMT or 12 percent lower than last year, and 0.2 MMT lower than the\nofficial USDA forecast. Post’s forecast is based on the assumption that the Russian ruble\nexchange rate will remain stable and therefore Russian grain will be less competitive in the\nworld markets. An expected decrease in domestic grain prices will make grain more attractive\nfor feed producers and Russia’s restrictions on imports of soybeans and meal11 may stimulate\nfeed consumers to use more grain in feeding rations;\n- 4.1 MMT of corn, 0.3 MMT less than in MY 2015/16, and 0.4 MMT less than the official USDA\nforecast. Post has forecast corn exports lower that the official USDA forecast based on Post’s\nforecast of a corn crop that is lower than USDA’s forecasted corn crop, tight competition in the\nworld markets, and a possible increase in domestic demand from feed consumers;\n- 0.8 MMT of other grains and pulses.\n11\n\nRussia banned imports of soybeans from the U.S. based on phytosanitary concerns and tightened control over imports of\nsoybeans and feeds that may contain GE lines not-registered in Russia but widely used in countries that are the largest\nproducers of soybeans, such as South American countries.\n\n\u000cAccording to the most recent Russian Customs data12, in MY 2015/16 (July 2015 through June 2016)\nRussia exported 35.7 MMT of grain and major grain products, including 33.48 MMT of grains, 0.92\nMMT of pulses, almost 0.34 MMT of flour in grain equivalent, 0.2 MMT of groats, including\nbuckwheat and rice, and almost 0.79 MMT of bran.

This year the grain stocks in southern European Russia\n(on July 1, 2016) included some grain from the new crop. However, last year less grain of the new crop\nwas included in carry-over stocks. Thus, in the course of one month (from June 1, 2016 to July 1,\n2016), the grain stocks in southern European Russia increased from 2.7 MMT to almost 4.7 MMT.\n\n16\n\n17\n\nRosstat does not count grain at small farms and at individual entrepreneurs.\nhttp://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b04_03/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d01/141zerno18.htm\n\n\u000cSource: Rosstat\nGrain stocks in the southern European Russia, the main exporting region, on July 1, 2016 were the\nhighest in the last 3 years, the years of high grain exports, and this high level of stocks, along with\nprospects of good crop, are a good basis for continued exports of grain from Russia.\n\nSource: FAS/Moscow based on Rosstat data\n\n\u000cPolicy\nBy the beginning of the new marketing year the Russian government did not make any significant\nchanges in its grain policy.\nThe floating export duty on wheat is still in force despite strong lobbying by the grain producers and\ngrain traders. This export duty on wheat is 50 percent of customs value, minus 6,500 rubles, but not less\nthan 10 rubles per 1 MT. Stabilization of the ruble exchange rate at approximately 63-64 rubles per $1,\nand a decrease of FOB prices on wheat to $175-180 per 1 MT keep this export duty at the lowest level18.\nGrain procurement interventions for the 2015 crop were discontinued on April 2016. According to the\nMinistry of Agriculture, as of July 15, 2016, the total volume of grain in the Federal Intervention Fund\nwas 3,268,200 MT, and the value of this grain was 28,899.5 million rubles. The Minister of Agriculture\nreported in mid-June 2016 of plans to purchase up to 2 million metric tons of grain to the Intervention\nFund in the marketing year 2016/17.\nOn July 19, 2016 the Ministry of Agriculture published the Order on the target prices for procurement\ninterventions for the 2016 grain crop 2016. The draft of this order was ready in the end of March 2016,\nand was registered with the Russian Ministry of Justice on April 20, 2016. However, it was not released\nto the public until July 19, 2016. For all of Russia the prices were set as following: soft milling wheat\nClass 3 – 10,900 Rubles per 1 MT, for soft milling wheat Class 4 – 10,400 rubles per 1 MT, for soft\nwheat Class 5 – 8,800 rubles per 1 MT, for rye of not worse than Class 3 – 7,400 rubles per 1 MT, for\nbarley – 8,000 rubles per 1 MT, and for corn Class 3 – 7,900 rubles per 1 MT19. Prior to the release of\nthe Order, the Russian Agricultural Minister reported that grain procurement intervention, which start\nwhen market prices fall below the target, will be held selectively. Industry analysts consider that the\nselected regions will be West Siberia and Ural FDs. The current market price for wheat in these regions\nis close to the announced intervention prices: approximately 10,900 rubles for wheat Class 3, and 10,300\nrubles for wheat Class 4. The prices for such wheat in European Russia vary from 9,750 to 10,300\nrubles per 1 MT for wheat Class 3 and from 8,800 to 9,870 rubles per 1 MT for wheat Class 4 with a\ndecreasing trend. Market prices for rye, barley and corn are higher than the target procurement prices\nall over Russia.\nIn MY 2015/16, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary\nSurveillance (VPSS), subordinated to the Ministry of Agriculture, increased activities targeted toward\nthe development of new foreign markets for Russian grain. This target was set as a priority for Russian\ngrain policy20. VPSS increased their negotiation activities, particularly with regard to quarantine,\nphytosanitary and grain quality requirements of countries importing Russian grain, such as China and\nIran21. In addition VPSS strengthened controls over storing and handling of grain in transit from\nproducer to consumer, including exports. However, the results of these activities are not yet clear.\nGrain exports to China are still low, in MY 2015/16 Russia exported only small amounts of corn (less\nthan 50,000 MT total) to China. Prospects of exports of wheat from Siberia to China are hampered by\nthe high cost of logistics, more than high Chinese quality and phytosanitary requirements. Exports of\n18\n\nFor example: 64R*180=11,520R =\u003e 11,520*50%=5,760R =\u003e 5,760-6,500. The difference is a negative number and the\nexport duty then defaults to the minimum value of only 10 rubles per 1 MT.\n19\nhttp://www.mcx.ru/documents/document/v7_show/35226..htm\n20\n21\n\nhttp://tass.ru/pmef-2016/article/3374788\nhttp://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/17725.html\n\n\u000cRussian grain to Iran are relatively high, but decreased in MY 2015/16 compared with exports in MY\n2014/15. For example, wheat exports decreased from 1.7 MMT in MY 2014/15 to 1.5 MMT in MY\n2015/16, barley exports decreased from 0.8 MMT to 0.5 MMT, and corn exports decreased from 0.25\nMMT to 0.2 MMT. According to industry analysts, the potential for growth of Russian grain exports is\nbased on the marketing activities of traders and the relatively low prices of Russian grain compared with\nthe quality/price characteristics of competitors in the world grain markets. Moreover, some traders\ncomplain that VPSS’s excessive control over storing and handling of grain add to the traders’ expenses,\nmaking the cost of exported grain even less competitive.\nMarketing\nIn MY 2015/16, market prices were very close to MY 2014/15. Market prices in rubles for domestic\ngrains reached a peak in January-February 2016, and have since been decreasing. At the same time, the\nruble decreased compared to the U.S. dollar, and the gap between the ruble price of grain and the dollar\nprice of grain widened, stimulating exports of Russian grain (Chart

The increase in imports is due to higher demand from feed mills. Post also\nslightly revised MY 2015/16 corn production estimates down from 9.4 to 9.3 MMT. A rainy dry season\nis providing greater opportunities for farmers to grow paddy during Indonesia’s second and third crop\ncycles. Post therefore revises the estimate of MY 2015/16 Indonesian paddy production 35.6 to 36.2\nMMT of milled rice equivalent.\n\n\u000cPost:\nJakarta\nSECTION I. SITUATION AND OUTLOOK\nIn early June 2016, the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (Badan\nMeteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika, BMKG) reported that Indonesia will experience higher than\nnormal rains during the last semester of 2016 (a wet dry season). As of May/June 2016, about 31.6\npercent of Indonesia (including parts of Aceh, North Sumatera, East Kalimantan, East Java, and East\nNusa Tenggara) has started to transition to the dry season, while the remaining 68.4 percent is\nexperiencing an atypically extended rainy season. The expected higher rainfall intensity during the\n2016 dry season (normally occurring between April and September) is due to:\n1. The arrival of a La Nina phenomenon, as indicated by lower sea surface temperatures in the\neastern Pacific Ocean, while Indonesian ocean sea surface temperatures are warming;\n2. A Negative Dipole Mode Index, which reached -0.53 centigrade. The negative trend is expected\n\nto continue until September 2016. A Negative Dipole Mode will result in higher rainfall in\nIndonesia;\n3. The arrival of a Madden – Julian Oscillation phenomenon, which is the extension and sealing of\nair from the Indian Ocean eastward. This will potentially lead to high rainfall in Sumatera, West\nKalimantan, South Kalimantan, and Java.\nBased on the above mentioned factors, major parts of Indonesia, including the production areas of\nSumatera, Java, and Kalimantan, will experience a wet dry season from July to September 2016.\nIndonesia normally starts the onset of the rainy season in October. Therefore, Post expects that most of\nthe major food crop producing areas will continue to receive sufficient rainfall through 2016.\n\nChart 1. Forecast of Rainfall Intensity in July 2016\n\n\u000cSource: BMKG\n\nChart 2. Forecast of Rainfall Intensity in August 2016\n\nSource: BMKG\n\nChart 3. Forecast of Rainfall Intensity in September 2016\n\n\u000cSource: BMKG\n\nWheat\nPost revises MY 2015/16 Indonesian wheat import estimates to 8.9 MMT from the previous estimate of\n7.6 MMT. The increase is mainly driven by higher demand from feed mills. Post therefore expects that\nU.S. wheat exports to Indonesia will slightly increase to 700,000 MT in MY 2015/16.\nCorn\nPost revises its MY 2015/16 Indonesian corn production estimates, slightly decreasing production from\n9.4 to 9.3 MMT. The decrease is due to favorable weather that prompted farmers to grow paddy in the\nplace of corn on rain-fed areas. Assuming normal weather, production is expected to increase to 9.5\nMMT in MY 2016/17. MY 2015/16 Indonesian corn imports are estimated to further decline to 2.1\nMMT due to continued corn import restrictions imposed by the government.\nRice\nDeclines in MY 2015/16 corn production is in relation to more favorable weather for growing paddy.\nPost revises the estimate of MY 2015/16 Indonesian paddy harvested area to 12.0 million hectares from\nthe previous estimate of 11.8 million hectares. Thus, it is estimated that MY 2015/16 Indonesian paddy\nproduction will increase to 36.2 MMT compared to the previous estimate of 35.6 MMT of milled rice\nequivalent. Considering higher production estimates, Post expects MY2015/16 Indonesian rice imports\nwill decline to 1.8 MMT compared to the initial estimate of 2.0 MMT.\nWHEAT\n\n\u000cTrade\nIndonesian feed mills continue to face difficulties meeting feed corn demand due to 2015/16 weatherrelated production declines and GOI restriction on corn imports. In response to low local supplies and\nimport barriers, feed mills are substituting corn with imported feed wheat. The Indonesian Flour Mills\nAssociation (APTINDO) reports that there are 22 feed mills importing feed wheat, resulting in a feed\nwheat import surge since September 2015. Global Trade Atlas and APTINDO data indicate that wheat\nimports from July 2015 to May 2016 have reached a total of 8.2 MMT compared to 6.7 MMT between\nJuly 2014 and May 2015. Considering the aforementioned factors, Post estimates that Indonesia’s MY\n2015/16 wheat imports will increase to 8.9 MMT, compared to the previous estimate of 7.6 MMT.\nThe GOI recognizes that the uptick in feed wheat imports poses a threat to their corn self-sufficiency\npolicies. In response, MOA stopped issuing import recommendations for feed wheat starting in June\n2016. MOA’s shutdown of feed wheat imports, combined with weak exchange rates is expected to slow\nIndonesian wheat import growth from an average annual rate of 6-7 percent to approximately 5 percent.\nAt these levels, Indonesian wheat imports are expected to contract to 8.5 MMT in MY 2016/17. Wheat\nexports to Indonesia during the July 2015 to May 2016 period were led by Australia (43 percent),\nCanada (18 percent), Ukraine (15 percent), Argentina (8 percent), and the United States (8 percent).\nAustralia’s majority market share is due to the noodle industry’s preference for Australian standard\nwhite wheat, price, and Australia’s close proximity. Considering these factors, U.S. wheat exports to\nIndonesia in MY 2015/16 are expected to reach 700,000 MT.\nPost reported in GAIN ID1610 that Indonesia was expected to implement an anti-dumping duty for\nimports of Indian and Turkish wheat flour (HS Code 1101.00.10.10 and 1101.00.10.90) in the first half\nof 2016. As of July 2016, however, the GOI has not taken action on this matter. The anti-dumping duty\nwas originally conceived in response to APTINDO’s March 2014 request to the Indonesian AntiDumping Commission (Komisi Anti Dumping Indonesia, KADI) to create a new safeguard following the\ntermination of Indonesia’s wheat flour quota. An anti-dumping duty was proposed that would range\nbetween 5.6 and 28.9 percent, with a limited duration of four years from the implementation date. (The\ncurrent import duty for imports of wheat flour is 5 percent).\nImporters note that wheat flour imports did not increase significantly in 2015 due to the depreciating\nRupiah. High freight rates also discouraged wheat flour imports from Sri Lanka, India, and Turkey.\nDomestic flour dominated the market throughout CY 2015, with a 98 percent market share. According\nto Global Trade Atlas data, during the period of July 2015 to April 2016, Turkey held the largest market\nshare of wheat flour exports to Indonesia (58 percent), followed closely by Ukraine (18 percent), and Sri\nLanka (11 percent). In MY 2014/15, Indonesia imported a total of 130,935 MT of wheat flour (179,119\nMT of wheat equivalent). This represents a decline from MY 2013/14 wheat flour imports of 225,392\nMT (308,336 MT of wheat equivalent).\nConsumption\nIn line with increasing feed wheat imports, Post revises the MY 2015/16 feed and residual wheat\nconsumption estimate to approximately 1.3 MMT, compared to the previous estimate of 450,000 MT.\nMY 2016/17 feed wheat consumption is expected to decline to 550,000 MT based on the\n\n\u000cdiscontinuation of feed wheat import recommendations. MY 2015/16 food wheat consumption is\nestimated to increase by 4.2 percent to 7.5 MMT, compared to the previous estimate of 7.2 MMT. This\nincrease reflects population growth, several new-to-market instant noodle brands, and the growth of the\nhigh-end retail bakery segment. MY 2016/17 food wheat consumption is forecast to grow to 7.7 MMT.\nCORN\nProduction\nThe late onset of the 2016 rainy season delayed the first crop planting of corn. Farmers reported that\nmost of the corn in upland areas was planted towards the end of November 2015 (two to three weeks\nlate), and was harvested in late February or early March 2016. Indonesia’s first corn season normally\ntakes place from November to February (49 percent). The second season takes place from March to\nJune (37 percent), while the third runs from July to September (14 percent). No significant pest and\ndisease incidents were reported during the first corn crop cycle of MY 2015/16.\nWith the arrival of La Nina weather during the second crop cycle (as explained above), farmers on\nlowland rain-fed areas have increased paddy plantings (their crop of preference) over corn due to\nsufficient rainfall. On the other hand, Post observations in Central and West Java confirm that rain-fed\nupland farms are planting mung beans in the place of soybean and corn. Upland farmers in Central and\nWest Java report that higher-than-normal rainfall caused corn and soybean germination problems. More\nrainfall also led to higher rates of downy mildew and stem rot on corn.

Based on reductions in harvested area and yield, Post expects that MY 2015/16 Indonesian corn\nproduction will decline to 9.3 MMT, compared to the initial estimate of 9.4 MMT.\nChart 4. Indonesia: Corn Harvest Pattern 2011 – 2015\n\nSource: Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS).\n\nHarvested corn area is expected to decrease to 3.14 million hectares in MY2016/17, as rainy weather is\nforecast to continue. Additionally, if rainy weather continues, farmers on upland rain-fed areas may\nalso switch from corn and soybean to paddy. Post thus expects MY 2016/17 corn production to fall to\n9.5 MMT. Post notes that corn production declines may be slightly offset by the increased use of higher\nyielding hybrid corn.\nFarm-gate corn prices ranged from Rp. 5,000/kg ($381/MT) in West Java to Rp. 2,700/kg ($206/MT) in\nCentral Java in June 2016. The price of hybrid corn seed has been relatively stable, ranging from Rp.\n\n\u000c60,000/kg ($4.6/kg) to Rp. 85,000/kg ($6.5/kg). (This compares with Rp. 60,000/kg ($4.6/kg) to Rp.\n80,000/kg ($6.1/kg) in 2015).\nConsumption\nThe Indonesian Feed Producers Association (Asosiasi Produsen Pakan Indonesia, APPI) reports that the\ncurrent economic slowdown, categorized by the weak rupiah-U.S. dollar exchange rate and depressed\nconsumer purchasing power, is expected to continue to slow commercial poultry feed consumption\ngrowth. APPI estimates that Indonesian feed consumption will increase by 8 percent to 17.3 MMT in\nCY 2016.\nThe poultry industry consumes approximately 83 percent of Indonesia’s animal feed. Aquaculture\nconsumes 11 percent and the remaining six percent is consumed by cattle and swine. The Indonesian\npoultry industry reports that the CY 2016 poultry population is expected to reach 3.224 billion broilers,\n150 million layers, and 24.8 million breeders. Demand for aquaculture feed in CY 2016 is estimated to\nincrease by 13 percent due to an increase in demand for shrimp in the international market. 84 feed mills\nare currently operational in Indonesia, with expansion continuing. Due to the continued expansion of\nexisting mills, there is an additional 1.5 MMT installed capacity, raising total installed capacity of\nIndonesian feed mills to 21 MMT per annum. Millers report that Indonesian mills are running at 70 – 80\npercent capacity.\nDespite higher demand for corn from feed mills and an expected lower supply from the domestic\nmarket, MOA continues its corn import restrictions. Import restrictions are driving down MY 2015/16\nfeed corn consumption estimates, which are now set at 7.2 MMT. The balance is met from imported\nfeed wheat, as described above. MOA is planning to fully stop corn imports in MY 2016/17. Despite\nobservations that the feasibility of this plan is questionable, MY 2016/17 feed corn consumption is\nrevised to 7.6 from 9.0 MMT. Additionally, The Indonesian National Economic Survey reports that\nfood corn consumption is decreasing by 6.33 percent per annum. Therefore, Post estimates that\nIndonesian food corn consumption will decline to from 4.2 MMT in MY 2014/15 to 4.1 MMT in MY\n2015/16. Corn consumption is expected to continue declining to 4.0 MMT in MY 2016/17 as consumers\nsubstitute rice and wheat-based food products.\nIndonesian feed millers are heavily reliant on imported feed ingredients. Factors inhibiting feed millers\nfrom sourcing ingredients locally include low protein content, high raw fiber content, rancidity, limited\nand inconsistent corn supplies for commercial scale feed millers, and storage challenges. Given these\nchallenges and Indonesia’s expanding livestock sector, feed millers report inelastic demand for imported\ncorn.\nTrade\nIndonesia’s corn demand is larger than its domestic supply, with corn constituting about 80 percent of\nIndonesian feed energy sources. Domestic production, while increasing, faces challenges due to\ninconsistent seasonal supplies and poor post-harvest management (resulting in high moisture content\nand high aflatoxin levels). Despite strong domestic demand, MY 2014/15 saw corn exports reach\n230,000 MT, compared to MY2013/14 exports of 12,000 MT. Post notes that Indonesian exports were\nthe result of regional trade between Sulawesi and the Philippines, where transportation costs are more\n\n\u000cadvantageous than shipping to Java or Sumatera. The GOI has nonetheless used this scenario as\njustification of the success of its self-sufficiency objectives, resulting in restrictions and unclear corn\nimport policies.\nUntil November 6, 2015, feed mills importing corn were bound by the policies referred to by a 2002\nDirector General for Livestock and Animal Health Service’s (DGLAHS) circular letter. On November\n25, 2015, MOA issued Regulation No. 57/2015 on Imports and Exports of Plant Based Feed\nIngredients. The regulation stated that the Minister of Trade will issue import permits for any plantbased feed ingredients imports. In order for this regulation to be implemented, the Ministry of Trade\nmust also issue a corresponding regulation to MOA 57/2015 for the administration of import licensing.\nTo date, the Ministry of Trade has not issued any regulation related to this matter, creating uncertainty\nfor corn importers and livestock producers.\nFeed millers continue to import corn despite the lack of clear regulations. Approximately 445,000 MT\nof corn was imported during November and December 2015, but MOA declared the imports illegal. In\nlate January 2016, the GOI designated the Indonesian National Logistics Agency (BULOG) as the sole\nauthorized importer for corn. BULOG assumed ownership of the detained corn shipments and then\ntransferred the title to feed millers with an agreement that 20 percent of the imported corn would be\ndistributed, at a set price, to smaller poultry farms self-mixing feed rations. Additionally, the GOI\ndecided that Indonesia will import 2.4 MMT of corn in CY 2016 at a rate of 600,000 MT per quarter.\nTo reinforce this, on May 25, 2016, GOI issued presidential decree No. 48/2016 on the Assignment to\nBULOG in the Context of National Food Security. The decree generally orders BULOG to ensure the\nsupply of staple foods and stabilize their prices. Staple foods include rice, corn, soybean, sugar, cooking\noil, wheat flour, shallot, chilies, beef, broiler meat, and eggs. Especially for corn, rice, and soybean,\nBULOG must:\na. Ensure stable prices at the consumer and producer level.\nb. Manage government reserves.\nc. Ensure the supply and distribution of staple foods.\nd. Import staple foods.\ne. Develop food based industries, and\nf. Develop food storage.\nFurthermore on rice, BULOG must:\na. Ensure stable prices of rice at the consumer and producer level.\nb. Manage government rice reserves.\nc. Ensure supply and distribution of rice for certain population groups.\nd. Import rice.\ne. Develop rice based industries including paddy and rice production and processing.\nf. Develop rice storage.\n\nIn ensuring sufficient supply of the staple foods, BULOG must prioritize domestic procurement over\nimports. On rice for the poor distribution, BULOG will refer to the direction of the Ministry for Social\nAffairs, while for the distribution of corn and soybean BULOG must refer to the direction of the\nMinistry of Industry. For the distribution of other staple foods, BULOG will follow guidelines from the\n\n\u000cIndonesian Ministry of Trade.\nDespite growing feed mill capacity, the above mentioned restrictions are expected to impede import\ngrowth. Therefore, Post revises its MY 2015/16 corn import estimate down from 3.0 to 2.1 MMT. MY\n2016/17 corn imports are forecast to increase marginally to 2.2 MMT, reflecting Indonesia’s slight\nforecasted production increase and growing feed mill demand. According to Global Trade Atlas,\nIndonesian corn imports originated from Brazil (64 percent), Argentina (27 percent), and the United\nStates (6 percent) during the October 2015 to April 2016 period.\nRICE, MILLED\nProduction\nThe first paddy crop plantings of MY 2015/16 were delayed in major production areas due to the late\narrival of the rainy season (December arrival and January/February 2016 peak). Typically, irrigated\nfarms are planted to paddy during the first crop cycle (October – February), followed by paddy on the\nsecond crop cycle (March to June), and ended by growing paddy or secondary crops such as corn, mung\nbean, soybean, peanut, or sweet potato during the third crop cycle (July – October). In the 2015/16\nseason, the first paddy crop planting was delayed to the end of December or January in most areas in\nCentral Java, East Java, Lampung, and NTT. Post now expects harvest delays for MY 2015/16 third\ncrops, especially on irrigated lowland areas. However, with the arrival of La Nina-type weather and\nrains in June, farmers working rain-fed lowland areas in Sumatera, Java, and Kalimantan may have\nsufficient rainfall to continue growing paddy during the second and third crops cycles instead of corn or\nsoybean.\nRainy dry seasons tend to provoke a higher incident of pest and diseases. Post observation in Central\nand West Java confirm farmers and GOI reports of increased incidents of neck blast, brown hoppers,\nstem borer, and rice ear bugs.\n\nTable 2: Total Area Impacted By Major Pest and Diseases in Hectares\n(Stem borer, brown hoppers, rats, neck blast).\nN\n\nProvinces\n\nPaddy\n\n\u000co.\n\n2015\nM\n\nI\n\nH\n\n23,84\n3\n\n1,69\n6\n\n185\n\n4,582\n\n475\n\n2,299\n\n2016*\nF\n\nTotal\n\nM\n\nI\n\nH\n\nF\n\nTotal\n\n9\n\n25,73\n3\n\n7,730\n\n231\n\n32\n\n-\n\n7,993\n\n56\n\n43\n\n5,155\n\n2,657\n\n143\n\n58\n\n13\n\n2,870\n\n588\n\n172\n\n42\n\n3,102\n\n1,082\n\n263\n\n93\n\n17\n0\n\n1,608\n\n1,463\n\n538\n\n103\n\n1\n\n2,105\n\n751\n\n427\n\n302\n\n-\n\n1,480\n\n570\n\n66\n\n23\n\n1\n\n660\n\n673\n\n351\n\n47\n\n1\n\n1,072\n\n35,33\n8\n\n6,81\n4\n\n8,29\n6\n\n6,3\n58\n\n56,80\n5\n\n24,91\n4\n\n1,59\n2\n\n166\n\n2\n\n26,67\n4\n\n2,914\n\n226\n\n2\n\n-\n\n3,142\n\n1,593\n\n223\n\n16\n\n-\n\n1,832\n\n9,147\n\n127\n\n13\n\n-\n\n9,287\n\n193\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n193\n\n446\n\n3\n\n-\n\n-\n\n449\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n125\n\n120\n\n8\n\n-\n\n253\n\n42\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n42\n\n1\n\nPemerintah\nAceh\n\n2\n\nSumatera Utara\n\n3\n\nSumatera Barat\n\n4\n\nRiau\n\n5\n\nJambi\n\n6\n\nSumatera\nSelatan\n\n7\n\nBengkulu\n\n8\n\nLampung\n\n9\n\nKep.

Overall MY 2015/16 yields are estimated to decline slightly from 4.7511 to\n4.711 MT per hectare due to harvest coinciding with rainy weather and increased pest and disease\nincidents.\nJava’s main paddy harvest ended in most areas in late April 2016, and was immediately followed by a\nsecond cycle of paddy. The second paddy harvest is expected to take place in mid or late August 2016.\nPictures above: Various stages of paddy plantings in Central and West Java in mid-June 2016.\nSource: FAS Jakarta\n\n\u000cChart 5. Indonesia: Rice Harvest Pattern 2011 - 2015\n\nSource: BPS\n\nConsidering the above mentioned situation, Post revises its MY 2015/16 paddy production estimate up\nto 57.0 MMT from 56.063 MMT. The increase is based on larger harvested areas during the second and\nthird crop cycles that resulted from higher rainfall on lowland rain-fed areas. Post also expects MY\n2016/17 paddy production to increase to 57.638 MMT based on additional carry over from MY 2015/16\nthird crops.\nTrade\nBULOG has set its procurement target at 3.2 MMT of milled rice equivalent for MY 2015/16. As of\nDecember 2015, BULOG realized approximately 2.0 MMT of the MY 2014/15 procurement target,\nwith ending stocks at 1.439 MMT. BULOG normally meets 60 percent of its procurement target during\nthe first main harvest period. Despite the delay in the MY 2015/16 first harvest, BULOG procurements\ntotaled 1.8 MMT as of the end of June, 2016. This is higher than 1.5 MMT procured during the same\nperiod last year, although still less than the 60 percent benchmark. June is usually the most important\nmonth for BULOG domestic procurement objectives.\nThe GOI has instructed BULOG to maintain a minimum secure stock level of 2 MMT by the end of the\nyear. With the current government purchase price for rice (HPP), BULOG may find it difficult to meet\nits procurement target, as the delayed harvest, combined with inflation, will push paddy prices up.\nAssuming that BULOG will be able to reach its procurement target from domestic sources, the GOI will\nstill need to consider imports to maintain BULOG’s stock at prescribed levels.\n\nIn October 2015, the GOI instructed BULOG to import a total of 1.5 MMT of medium quality rice from\n\n\u000cVietnam and Thailand to maintain BULOG’s CY 2015 ending stock at 1.5 MMT. Based on Global\nTrade Atlas data, a total of 600,000 MT of imported rice arrived in country as of November 2015.\nBULOG reported that a total of 700,000 MT of the authorized imports were carried over to MY\n2015/16.\nIndonesian regulations restrict rice imports one month prior, during, and two months after the main\nharvest period. Indonesian regulations only permit BULOG to import medium quality rice; while\nprivate companies can import specialty rice (jasmine rice, basmati rice, sushi rice, rice for diabetics and\nrice seed, for example). However, since the end of 2014, MOA has refused to issue any import\nrecommendation for japonica rice, claiming that japonica rice can be substituted with similar Indonesian\nvarieties. On December 8, 2015, MOT stipulated in Regulation 103/2015 on Rice Imports and Exports\nthat japonica rice (HS. 1006.30.99.00) is permitted for import into Indonesia. In order for japonica rice\nimports to resume, the Ministry of Agriculture must agree to issue import recommendations.\nIndonesian rice prices are considered the highest in the international market, providing incentives for\nillegal rice imports.\nChart 6. Indonesia: Rice Price Comparisons\n\nSource: Cipinang wholesale rice market, The Rice Trader, processed by FAS Jakarta.\n\nWith estimated higher rice production combined with carry over imports from last year and higher\ndemand for specialty rice, Post expects that MY 2015/16 imports will decrease to 1.8 MMT from the\nprevious estimate of 2.0 MMT. Post forecasts that MY 2016/17 Indonesian imports of rice will further\ndecline to 1.25 MMT, in line with the forecast production increase and higher MY 2015/16 ending\nstocks.\n\nConsumption\n\n\u000cIn MY 2015/16, BULOG will allocate 2.795 MMT of rice for the Raskin program to 15,530,897 poor\nfamilies. Each family will receive 15 kg of rice/month for 12 months at the price of Rp. 1,600/kg. As of\nJune 2016, BULOG distributed approximately 1.8 MMT of rice under the Raskin program.\nData from the 2013 Indonesia National Economic Survey (Susenas) shows an average decline in per\ncapita rice consumption of 1.62 percent per annum. The decline in rice consumption is due to some\nswitching to wheat flour-based foods such as instant noodle and bread. The price of a pack of instant\nnoodle is approximately Rp. 2,000/pack ($0.15/pack) and can be eaten without any side dishes,\ncompared to the rice price of Rp. 9,400 – 11,750/kg ($703 - $879/MT). Post maintains the MY 2015/16\nconsumption estimate at 38.3 MMT. Post expects Indonesian rice consumption to remain unchanged at\n38.3 MMT in MY 2016/17.\nStocks\nPost estimates MY 2015/16 rice ending stocks to rise to 3.611 MMT, tracking with rice production\nincreases. MY 2016/17 ending stocks are expected to decline to 3.161 MMT based on lower imports\nand stagnant consumption.\nPrices\nThe price of wet paddy and rice remain above the HPP, despite the ongoing harvest. Current farm gate\nprices of wet paddy in Java range from Rp. 3,300/kg ($251/MT) to 4,800/kg ($366/MT). The average\nprice of medium quality rice at Cipinang wholesale market also decreased to Rp. 9,900/kg ($754/MT)\nfrom Rp. 10,198/kg ($777/MT) in March 2016.\n\nPSD TABLES\nTable 3.

A La Nina event is expected to\nbring higher than normal levels of rainfall in MY 2016/17, helping palm oil production recover to 33.5\nMMT. Indonesia's biodiesel program is driving industrial domestic consumption and is expected to\ngrow to 3.5 MMT, bringing total consumption to 9.62 MMT in MY 2016/17. Soybean production is\nexpected to remain unchanged at 600 thousand MT in MY 2016/17.\n\n\u000cPost:\nJakarta\n\nOil, Palm\nProduction\nAn El-Nino weather event resulted in drought throughout Indonesia in 2015, including key palm oil\nproduction areas in southern Sumatera and southern Kalimantan. Post field observations in June 2016\nverified that production declines are peaking, with plantation managers reporting yield declines as low\nas 5 percent and as high as 40 percent. Peak yield declines correspond with a lag of approximately six to\nnine months following dry weather. As a result, fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production has been offset by\nmale flower production by up to 50 percent in some areas. Additionally, FFB are yielding crude palm\noil (CPO) at lower rates than normal, mostly due to smaller FFBs with fewer fruits. Considering the\nseverity of production declines in some areas, Post reduces MY 2015/16 production estimates to 32\nmillion metric tons (MMT).\nDespite low production, the same production areas in southern Kalimantan and Sumatera are currently\nexperiencing new rainfall, raising expectations for normal conditions in 2016/17. Indonesia’s national\nweather agency (BKMG) supports this, forecasting a La Nina weather event in late 2016. A La Nina\nevent will bring higher than normal levels of rainfall. As a result, Post expects that production levels\nwill start their recovery in 2016/17. Given the severity of stress to some of the plantations, however, full\nrecovery is expected to take up to 24 months under normal rain conditions. Post therefore estimates\npalm oil production will reach 33.5 MMT in MY 2016/17.\nFigure 1. Drought Impact: Increasing male flower Production and Small Fruit Bunches\n\nSource: Post field observation, 2016\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MEF), a draft regulation is being prepared that\n\n\u000cwill implement a new moratorium on palm oil plantation expansion. A peatlands forest moratorium was\nalready established in 2011. MEF stated that 950 thousand hectares of forestland conversion permits\nhave already been suspended for palm plantation since the President’s moratorium order in April 2016.\n950 thousand ha is the equivalent of 11 percent of Indonesia's total existing planted areas.\nConsumption\nIndonesian palm oil consumption has been transformed through biodiesel blending and a subsidy\nprogram implemented in mid-2015. Biodiesel consumption had fallen close to zero by early 2015, but\nsurged ahead following the creation of a levy charged on palm oil exports. Funds gathered through the\nlevy are used to make up the difference between fossil fuels and palm oil-based biodiesel. As a result of\nthe levy program, more than 700 million liters of biodiesel were subsidized in the first quarter of 2016.\nThe Government of Indonesia (GOI) created the Plantation Fund Agency (BPDPKS) to manage the\nincome generated by the levy as well as distribute the subsidy. BPDPKS reports that the value of the\nlevy in 2016 will reach approximately IDR 9.5 trillion, or 698 million US dollars. Additionally,\nBPDPKS reports that initial estimates expected fossil fuel prices to stabilize at higher levels than what\nhas occurred. As a result, analysts believe that Indonesia may be able to subsidize between 2.5 – 2.8\nbillion liters of biodiesel in 2016.\nFigure 2. Fossil Diesel and Biodiesel Price Gap (IDR per liter)\n\nSource: indexmundi, MEMR (Ministry of Energy of Mineral Resource)\nAccording to the GOI’s Regulation 24/2016, BPDPKS has a mandate to subsidize biodiesel for\nelectricity generation. However, Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company PLN reports that a\nsignificant increase in biodiesel consumption for electricity generation is unlikely, as the company is\nmainly vested in coal burning power plants. They additionally note that B-30 blend is poorly adapted to\nthe few existing diesel powered generators. As a result, biodiesel consumption will remain primarily in\nthe on-road sector.\n\n\u000cConsidering the above, Post expects that Indonesian industrial palm oil consumption will reach 3.2\nMMT in MY 2015/16 and grow to 3.5 MMT in MY 2016/17. Increasing consumption will be driven by\nbiodiesel transportation sector. Domestic food consumption is expected to reach 5.8 MMT in MY\n2016/17, an increase of 100 TMT over MY 2015/16. Increases in food consumption are driven by\npopulation growth.\nTrade\nPalm oil prices reached 680 USD/MT in April 2016, their highest level since October 2014. High palm\noil prices correspond with low CPO yields related to the El Nino weather event and the growth of\nbiodiesel blending. Despite CPO price increases, palm oil continued to trade at a discount to soybean\noil, with the price differential narrowing to 62 USD in May 2016.\nFigure 3 Recent Price Trends for Selected Vegetable Oils (US$/MT)\n\nSource: indexmundi\nPost expects that Indonesian palm oil exports will decline slightly in 2015/16. The expected decline is\nthe result of palm oil prices, which are further exacerbated by Indonesia’s 50 dollar per ton levy on\nCPO. Additionally, the success of Indonesia’s biodiesel blending program is pushing up domestic\nconsumption, offsetting exports. Post notes that export declines to major export destinations have been\nled by China, the EU, and the African continent. Palm oil exports to China have declined by 12 percent\nover the previous year, primarily because of softening demand in China due to increased soybean\ncrushing for China’s growing livestock sector.\nBased on these reasons, Post expects Indonesian palm oil exports will decline from 25.9 MMT in MY\n2014/15 to 23 MMT in MY 2015/16. 2016/17 exports are currently estimated at 24 MMT.\nFigure 4 Indonesian Palm Oil and Palm Kernel Exports by Destination, TMT\n\n\u000cSource: GAPKI\nStocks\nIncreasing domestic demand is driving down stocks.

Dry weather throughout 2015/16 resulting from an El Nino phenomenon helped further\ndrive down soybean harvested area in favor of shorter duration crops such as mung beans. This is\nconfirmed by seed dealers, who noted a slight decline in soybean sales. As a result, Post estimates that\nharvested area dropped slightly from 450 to 440 thousand hectares. The resulting production decline is\nminimal, however, and Post’s estimate is therefore left unchanged. The MY 2016/17 Indonesia soybean\nproduction estimate also remains unchanged at 600 thousand MT.\nConsumption\nSoybeans and soybean products such as tempeh and tofu are staple proteins in the Indonesian diet.\nIndonesian soybean consumption is thus primarily concentrated in the human consumption category. As\nlow cost staple proteins, their consumption is relatively stable, with growth keeping pace with\npopulation increases. Based on this analysis, Post estimates Indonesian soybean human consumption\nwill reach 2.77 MMT in MY 2015/16 and 2.79 MMT in 2016/17. Feed soybean consumption is\nexpected to remain stable at 30 thousand MT.\nTrade\nIndonesia imports approximately 75 percent of its soybean requirement, with U.S. soybeans making up\nthe majority of their imports. Post notes that Indonesian soybean self-sufficiency objectives remain\nlargely unrealized, with local officials and farmers noting that a significant change in local soybean\nproduction is highly unlikely. Post therefore expects Indonesia to continue importing soybeans at\nregular and consistent levels. MY 2015/16 imports are thus estimated to grow to 2.2 MMT and MY\n2016/17 will increase to 2.25 MMT.\nTable 1: Indonesia Soybean Imports, Reported by Exporters\n\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOct-April Total\nTotal\n\n2014/15\n59,687\n253,089\n247,938\n165,530\n256,607\n277,139\n156,803\n142,277\n171,108\n90,970\n117,917\n170,954\n1,416,793\n2,110,019\n\n2015/16\n84,818\n214,263\n123,659\n167,437\n298,402\n269,444\n326,513\n\n1,484,536\n1,484,536\n\n\u000cSource: GTIS\n\nStocks\nIndonesian soybean production remains unchanged, while imports and consumption are growing in\nsync.

The roadshow took place in seven of the biggest cities in the\ncountry. FAS/Sofia, with the support of local importers, successfully promoted big variety of U.S.\nagricultural products available on the Bulgarian market and used the opportunity to educate industry\nrepresentatives and end consumers about the high quality and diversity of U.S. food and beverages.\nAccording to statistics provided by the organizers, the campaign was broadly covered by more than 120\nspecialized, mainstream, and online media. More than 100,000 people visited the event (over 95% of\nthem visited the U.S. stall). The campaign reached more than 4.07 million Facebook users and the web\nsite of the campaign was visited more than 2.6 million times during the event from March 1st to May\n30th. (Remark: The population of Bulgaria is 7.2 million). So far there has not been another opportunity\nfor FAS/Sofia to reach such a large audience of current and potential consumers.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nTo promote culinary traditions of various countries to show their diversity and stimulate trade, culinary,\nand cultural partnership.\nThe purpose of FAS’ participation was to increase the importers, distributors, packers, retail, and HRI\nsector awareness of the high quality U.S. agricultural products currently available on the Bulgarian\nmarket, and to signify the bilateral trade and investment opportunities existing in the food and\nagricultural sector.\n2. Market Constraints and Opportunities:\nOpportunities\nIncrease of consumption of food and beverages is creating demand for more imports.\nMigration of people from rural to urban areas continues at a rapid pace.\nBulgarian value good quality food, innovative, healthy and reasonably priced products.\nGrowing food processing industry is looking for new imported food ingredients.\nEfficient domestic distribution network.\nBulgarian market is accessible by sea.\nMarketing costs to increase consumer awareness are considerably low.\nConstraints\nBulgarian membership in the European Union puts U.S. exporters in a less favorable position than\nEU member states because of duties.\nReduced consumer budget due to price-conscious consumers.\nBulgarian domestic producers are receiving European funding to upgrade production efficiency and\nproduct quality.\nBulgarian farmers increase agricultural production, reducing demand for imports in the country.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate and current appreciation of the U.S. dollar against Euro puts U.S.\nexporters at a disadvantage compared with exporters of the EU. Bulgarian Lev (BGN) has a fixed\nexchange rate against the Euro (EURO 1 = BGN 1.95583)\n3. Expected Results and Desired Outcomes:\nDue to the anticipated high visitors’ attendance rate, it was expected that the awareness about U.S.\nagricultural products and culinary traditions will be strongly increased among end consumers as well as\namong current and potential importers, who were invited by FAS/Sofia, and others who attended\nindividually. The media and social media releases were expected to enhance broadly the informational\ncampaign. FAS/Sofia recruited importers to provide products to be displayed and sampled such as U.S.\nwhiskey, wine, tree nuts, dry fruits, popcorn, snack foods, beer, and pulses.\nAlthough end consumers are usually not an attainable target at FAS/Sofia’s promotions, the event\npromised to provide an excellent opportunity to reach this audience as well as to target current and\npotential importers, culinary experts and bloggers, and media representatives. FAS/Sofia also aimed to\nfurther strengthen relations with the importers by demonstrating efforts and ability to help promote their\nproducts.\n4. Actual results and Outcomes:\n\n\u000cOn May 12-28 FAS/Sofia participated in the first of a kind for Bulgaria culinary festival “Bulgaria\nMeets the Flavors of the World”. The event was organized by the Bulgarian Ministry of Tourism GTC\nBulgaria, HRC Culinary Academy, and International Women’s Club in Bulgaria in partnership with 18\nEmbassies, 7 Municipalities, 7 leading shopping centers, leading companies such as Coca-Cola,\nBulgaria Air, Wizz Air, Zagorka, Bilateral Chambers of Commerce, and over 150 private companies\nand importers. The campaign was officially launched on March 1st with a press conference lead by the\nDeputy Minister of Tourism and attended by Ambassadors, trade partners, and national media.\nThe roadshow was held in the shopping malls of seven of Bulgaria’s biggest cities as follows: opened\non May 12 in Stara Zagora and continued on May 14 in Burgas, May 16 in Plovdiv, May 18 in Veliko\nTarnovo, May 20 in Ruse, May 22 in Varna, and the closing event was held in Sofia on May 28.\nFAS/Sofia’s Marketing Specialist Alex Todorov represented FAS at the U.S. stall in five cities and\ndirectly interacted with industry, trade, HRI, and retail representatives as well as culinary professionals\nand media. He coordinated with importers, interested to have their U.S. products displayed and\npromoted, as well as provided information and promotional materials to the visitors. Mr. Todorov was\nthe main contact for the organizers regarding logistics and performance, met with current and potential\nimporters in each city, established relations with media representatives, bloggers, Culinary Academy\nofficials, and government representatives, and explored future promotional opportunities with them.\n\nThe USA stall\nThe organizers built a Gourmet Alley in the food court zone in the main shopping malls where each\ncountry had a designated booth/stall with a recognizable image. FAS/Sofia, with the support of the\nimporters, promoted various U.S. agricultural products available in Bulgaria such as whiskey, wine,\nnuts, dry fruits, popcorn, beer, beans, and lentils. The FAS Marketing Specialist provided the visitors\nwith information about U.S. agriculture and products, as well as giving away lots of handout\npromotional materials such as brochures, leaflets, etc. At the end of the alley there was a cooking\ninstallation where professional chefs conducted culinary shows three times a day and presented meals\ntypical for each country. All participants were given the liberty to decorate their stall per their personal\nvision of how to achieve best promotional effect.\n\n\u000cPromotional Banners in the Shopping Malls\nThe Mayors of each town supported the event and most of them participated in the openings. Many\nAmbassadors and other members of the diplomatic community attended as well. The closing event in\nSofia was opened by the Minister of Tourism and many diplomats. This helped to provide additional\npublicity to the event.\n\nThe Mayor of Plovdiv Ivan Totev at the opening (left) and in conversation with an Ambassador,\nFAS/Sofia booth immediately behind (right)\nExceptional outreach:\nAccording to statistics provided by the organizers, the event’s outreach exceeded everyone’s\nexpectations as it was broadly covered by more than 120 specialized, mainstream, and online media (a\nlist of media and links to online publications is available in attachment 1). More than 100,000 people\nvisited the event (over 95% of them visited the U.S. booth). The campaign reached more than 4.07\nmillion Facebook users and the web site of the campaign was visited more than 2.6 million times\nduring the campaign from March 1st to May 30th. (Remark: total population of Bulgaria is 7.2 million\npeople). So far there has not been another opportunity for FAS/Sofia to reach such a large audience of\nend consumers, industry professionals, media, and government representatives and to perform such a\nlarge-scale promotion of U.S. agricultural products and culinary traditions.\n\n\u000cOfficial opening in Stara Zagora and Ruse\nFAS/Sofia managed to recruit Coca-Cola HBC Bulgaria to participate in the event. Their representatives\nwere located right next to the USA booth. This was a strong attention-drawing factor for the visitors as\nfree Coca-Cola samples were given away, which together with the perfect location of the USA booth,\ndirected visitors’ flow straight to the booth. After getting a free Coca-Cola sample all visitors stopped\nby the USA booth and talked with the FAS Marketing Specialist about the displayed products as well as\nreceived promotional brochures about the products and information on where they can buy them.\n\nThe U.S. stall in Varna\nEach country’s culinary traditions were presented by a respected Chef from the HRC Culinary Academy\nat no cost for FAS. The used products were also paid by the organizers. USA’s culinary was represented\nby distinguished Chef Henri Donneaux, who is a Head Instructor at HRC Culinary Academy with over\n24 years of professional experience in Belgium, France, and the U.S., and who has worked with world\nrenowned 3 Michelin star Chefs.\n\n\u000cChef Henri Donneaux preparing an American meal\nThe organizers took full responsibility for the installation and transportation of the USA booth so FAS\ndid not incur any cost for that.\nUsually a single event in Bulgaria would cost about $3,000-$5,000, depending on venue and number of\ninvitees, and it would directly reach an audience of up to 200 people. With this event FAS/Sofia\nmanaged to directly approach an audience of close to 100,000 current and potential consumers and\nindirectly reached millions of potential consumers through media and social media at the cost of about\n$1,100 for FAS. If FAS/Sofia was to fully cover the financial aspect of this event, it would’ve cost at\nleast $10,000 and would have been more difficult to perform logistically. In addition to organizing an\nevent at a reduced cost and saving about $9,000 to FAS, for the past seven years FAS/Sofia have not\nhad an opportunity to organize a promotional activity outside of Sofia and make an outreach to potential\nconsumers in the countryside, which was successfully achieved by this event.\nThe Embassy’s Public Affairs Office supported the activity by announcing the event and posting\npictures from the main locations on the Embassy Facebook page. The Facebook posts received hundreds\nof likes and shares.\n\nEmbassy Facebook page posts\n\n\u000cThe event also included a noble charity element. Almost U.S. $10,000 were collected by the organizers\nand donated to hospitals, children in need, and their families.\nFAS/Sofia received a Certificate of Appreciation on behalf of the U.S. Ambassador in Bulgaria. The\ncertificate was received by FAS/Sofia’s Marketing Specialist from the Deputy Minister of Tourism in\nan official ceremony.\n\nFAS Sofia’s Marketing Specialist (left) receives Certificate of Appreciation from the Deputy Minister of\nTourism (right)\nThe effectiveness of the promotion will be measured by the number on trade leads generated and actual\nsales registered 90 and 180 days after the event. Post will conduct interviews with the importers to\nassess the quality and to obtain useful feedback for improvement of the promotional effort.\n\nLeft: Minister of Tourism opening the last event in Sofia; Right: Embassy’s Commercial Attaché Maria\nGalindo giving opening remarks and FAS Marketing Specialist (on the left)\n\n\u000cLeft: FAS Marketing Specialist and Jim Beam Brand Manager; Right: U.S. stall and sampling stations\nat Bulgaria mall in Sofia\nImporters and Promoted Brands:\nFAS/Sofia successfully promoted more than 30 brands and sub-brands, represented by 15 importers in\nBulgaria.

Recommendations/Follow–up evaluations:\nFAS/Sofia continues to maintain good contact with all of the importers and puts forward strong efforts\n\n\u000cto make them feel supported. The good relationship with the importers gives the opportunity to the FAS\noffice to obtain up-to-date information about the market trends and issues with the competitors and with\nthe local regulations. Such events also provide opportunity to FAS/Sofia to establish new contacts with\npeople from the industry.\nThe Embassy’s Ambassador expressed great satisfaction about the outcome of the event.

The rise\nof Indonesia’s biodiesel consumption is directly attributable to the country’s biodiesel subsidy, which\nunder a low oil price environment since 2015 is now financed through a levy on palm oil and palm oil\nproduct exports. Post expects domestic biodiesel production to remain robust, although Indonesia’s\nbiodiesel subsidy will be challenged by low palm oil production in 2015/16 and lower-than-expected\nfossil fuel prices. Post thus expects biodiesel production to reach 2.45 billion liters in 2016, a rebound\nfrom 2015, but still below record levels experienced in 2014.\n\n\u000cPost:\nJakarta\n\nI. Executive Summary\nIndonesia’s biofuel sector is based on palm oil-derived biodiesel used for on-road transportation.\nBiodiesel production is booming due to growing Indonesian demand, which more than offsets the drop\nin export demand resulting from duties implemented in 2013 and the 2014 collapse of oil prices. Rapid\ngrowth in Indonesia’s biodiesel blending and consumption is directly attributable to the country’s\nbiodiesel subsidy, which is financed through a levy on palm oil and palm oil product exports.\nThe new palm oil levy was implemented in summer 2015, collecting funds which are primarily used to\nsubsidize the difference between biodiesel and fossil fuels. Although blending sector contacts express\nconfidence that the levy will be able to subsidize production throughout the year, some contacts have\nrecently started to express concerns that subsidized production may decline in the latter parts of 2016.\nThey cite lower-than-expected fossil fuel prices as well as rising crude palm oil (CPO) prices as the\nmain reason for this concern.\nIndonesia does not use biodiesel for electricity generation or other off-road transportation uses in any\nsignificant quantity. Fuel ethanol refining does not occur in any significant quantity.\nII. Gasoline and Diesel\nIndonesian fuel consumption is shifting. Gasoline and jet fuel consumption has continued to grow while\ndiesel fuel consumption plateaued and then declining slightly in past two years (see Table 1). Energy\nexperts state that decreasing diesel fuel consumption is directly related to Indonesia’s slowing economic\ngrowth. This is further confirmed by Indonesia’s state-owned fuel company Pertamina, which noted that\nIndonesia’s industrial sector has lowered its demand for diesel due to poor economic performance.\nIndonesia’s transportation sector consumed around 80 percent of the country’s total diesel fuel\nconsumption in 2015.\nTable 1.

The GOI has stated that they will review and update\nthe subsidy amount every three months. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has stated their\nintention to reduce the diesel subsidy to IDR 500 per liter; however no action has yet been taken.\n\n\u000cFuel use outlook\nAccording to the Indonesian National Energy Council’s 2014 Indonesian Energy Outlook, Indonesian\nfuel consumption is projected to increase by five percent annually during the 2020-2026 periods (Table\n2). Indonesian Gasoline use is projected to reach 43 billion liters in 2020 and 60 billion liters by 2026,\nwhile diesel fuel use is expected to grow at a slower rate rising to 44 billion liters in 2026.\nTable 2.

Policy and Program:\nProgress on Plantation Fund for Biodiesel Subsidy\nIndonesia’s biodiesel subsidy is driving the expansion of palm oil-based biodiesel blending and\nconsumption in Indonesia. The program has been funded since 2015 through an export levy on CPO\nand CPO derivatives, and is managed by the CPO fund agency (BPDPKS). More than 1 billion liters of\nbiodiesel were absorbed under this program between January and June 2016, using the revenues\ngenerated by the levy to cover the difference between the cost of biodiesel and fossil fuels. The fund was\nestablished based through regulations 24/2015 and 61/2015, and started in summer 2015.\nAccording to BPDPKS, revenues from the levy are expected to reach IDR 9.5 trillion (about $698\nmillion dollars US) in 2016. The value of the subsidy depends on the difference between the price of\nbiodiesel and the fossil diesel, and is reported to have reached IDR 5000 per liter (37 cents a liter) in\nApril 2016. Despite low fossil fuel prices and strengthening CPO prices, BPDPKS is publicly optimistic\nthat they will be able to continue supplying subsidized automobile fuel at a consistent pace throughout\nthe year. Industry contacts, however, have expressed some doubts regarding this, as the cost of the\nsubsidy continues to grow and fossil fuels show no sign of rebounding prices in the short term. As such,\nPost believes that biodiesel subsidy volumes may decline later in the year, depending on financial\nconditions for fuel and CPO.\nIn the first half of 2016, Indonesia issued regulation 24/2016, allowing the CPO fund to subsidize\nbiodiesel for electricity generation. Industry sources estimate that the quantity of biodiesel required for\nelectricity generation is low, between 200-500 thousand kiloliters (KL) a year. Sources further indicate\nthat demand for electricity generation will remain low, as PLN (Indonesia’s National Electricity\nCompany) is reducing its reliance on diesel fuel-based power plants in favor of coal and natural gas.\nPLN data supports these claims, showing that biodiesel-generated electricity constituted less than 1\npercent of Indonesia’s total production in 2014, and projected increases would not significantly increase\nbiodiesel’s percent share of electricity generation. PLN currently estimates that fossil diesel contributes\nto seven percent of Indonesia’s total electricity generation, and that this will fall to one percent by 2025.\n\n\u000cHistoric Policy Background\nIndonesian biofuels policy is governed by a number of regulations and decrees. Government regulation\n1/2006 was an important first step for the development biofuels in Indonesia. The regulation governs\nthe procurement and usage of biofuels. In support of Regulation 1, Presidential decree 20/2006\nestablished a National Biofuels Development Team, which supervises biofuel implementation programs\nand has created a blueprint for biofuels development. According to the blueprint, biofuels development\naims to (1) alleviate poverty and unemployment, (2) drive economic activities through biofuel\nprocurement and (3) reduce domestic fossil fuel consumption. This was followed by Indonesia’s House\nof Representative (DPR), which passed Energy Law (UU 30/2007) to strengthen regulations prioritizing\nthe use of renewable energy and biofuels.\nIn 2008, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) created a biofuel blending mandate through Ministry of\nEnergy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) Regulation 32. The blending mandate regulation has been\nrevised several times, most recently through MEMR Regulation 12, released in March 2015. This\nregulation increases mandatory biodiesel blending from 10 percent to 15 percent for transportation and\nindustrial uses. Regulation 12 also increased mandatory blending to 25 percent for electricity\ngeneration. Post notes that despite an aggressive mandate, the potential for biofuel electricity generation\nin Indonesia remains limited.\nIndonesia’s biodiesel mandates have been aggressive historically. In 2014, blending rates were set at 10\npercent for 2014 and 2015. 2015 rates were revised up to 15 percent as per MEMR regulation 12/2015\n(See Table 3). Despite the rapid growth of Indonesia’s biofuel consumption however, they have yet to\nreach their blending mandates (See Figure 1). Industry sources confirm that blending has remained\nbelow target due to supply shortages, previously caused by infrastructure weaknesses and funding\nshortfalls for subsidies. Post notes, however, that necessary infrastructure, such as blending facilities and\nstorage tanks, is coming on line. Additionally, Indonesia’s new levy is providing a regular funding\nstream that will maintain biodiesel’s competitiveness, even in the face of low global fossil fuel prices.\nFigure 1. Domestic Consumption Continues to Fall Far Short of Indonesian Blending Mandates\n(million liters)\n\nSource: Post calculation, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.\n\nBlending mandate regulations define the minimum biofuel quantity used in each end use category for a\ncertain period of year. Table 3 shows GOI plans to increase the percentage use of biodiesel in total\ndiesel consumption up to 2025. This new target would require at least 4.86 billion liters of biodiesel to\nbe blended in the transportation sector in the next year, which does not appear attainable at this time.\n\n\u000cTable 3.

It is uniquely sold through Pertamina, an\nIndonesian state-owned company. Non-PSO refers to unsubsidized fuel sold through private sector shops.\n\nThe GOI’s ethanol mandatory schedule is shown in Table 4. Post notes that subsidies are only being\nimplemented for transportation sector biodiesel. Given the lack of ethanol infrastructure, feedstock\nsupply gaps, and the general focus on diesel, the GOI is unlikely to pursue ethanol blending.\nTable 4.

Biodiesel\nProduction\nIndonesia’s biodiesel sector weathered a difficult moment in 2015. Faced with sharply lower foreign\ndemand due to low fossil fuel prices and curtailed domestic demand due to a break in subsidy support,\nbiodiesel production dropped to zero in the first half of the year. Indonesia addressed past, only partially\nsuccessful schemes to support domestic consumption through the creation of the Plantation Fund , but\nthe subsidies were not distributed until later in the year. With its implementation in summer 2015, the\nfund subsidized more than 300 million liters of biodiesel in 2015. This further jumped to 700 million\nliters in the first quarter of 2016. The levy currently charges 50 dollars per ton of exported CPO and less\nfor exported, value-added CPO products. Palm oil levy funds are also used to fund replanting activities\n(primarily for small holders).\nCPO is the most commonly available biodiesel feedstock in Indonesia, with production currently\nestimated at 32 million MT. (Alternate feedstocks such as candle nut, jatropha oil, calophyllum and\ncoconut oil are not available to the industry at competitive prices and/or commercial volumes). Although\nCPO production is expected to continue to grow, short term supplies are constrained due to an extended\ndrought in 2015. Looking to the long term, production should grow as new plantations reach maturity\nand old plantations are replaced with higher yielding cultivars.\nIndonesia’s biodiesel production capacity is growing. At least two refineries came online in 2015/16\nwith a total production capacity of 877 million liters. An additional 340 million liter refinery is expected\n\n\u000cto open in 2016/17. Palm oil refiners report that Indonesia’s refining capacity is underutilized, and that\nrefiners must compete in order to secure sufficient quantities of CPO to maintain production levels. Post\nnotes that this situation is aggravated by low CPO yields in 2015/16.\nConsumption\nThe implementation of Indonesia’s palm oil levy has transformed Indonesia’s biodiesel consumption. In\nearly 2015, biodiesel consumption had dropped to zero due to low fossil fuel prices and an ineffective\nsupport program. Under the new program, biodiesel production jumped, pushing Indonesia’s blend rate\ncloser to 8 percent in 2016. This compares favorably with the previous record 6 percent set in 2014, just\nprior to the collapse in foreign and domestic demand. Post notes that although 8 percent falls\nsignificantly short of Indonesia’s 20 percent mandate, this marks an aggressive jump from early 2015,\nwhen levels were at zero. Indonesian officials remain committed to reaching their 20 percent goal,\nwhich remains constrained by cheap fossil fuels and distribution challenges throughout the archipelago.\nAlthough Indonesia’s biofuel program covers several sectors (including electricity generation, industry,\nand transport), consumption remains highly concentrated in the subsidized transportation (PSO) sector.\nPSO use is limited to high population areas, primarily in Java and Sumatra. Biodiesel consumption for\nelectricity is low and is not expected to increase as Pertamina reports a growing reliance on coal-fueled\npower plants.\nThe first round of biodiesel procurement covered by the CPO fund subsidy was completed for the period\nof November 2015 to April 2016 and resulted in the creation of approximately 950 million liters. The\nsecond procurement will run from May to October 2016, and is expected to procure 1.5 billion liters of\nbiodiesel. Post expects that consumption will remain below the 20 percent mandate, but will remain\nrobust due to the success of the palm oil levy. As a result, Post estimates that biodiesel consumption will\nreach 2.2 billion liters in 2016, a sharp increase from 860 million liter in 2015. Multiple variables\ninfluence Post’s 2017 outlook. These include the price of fossil fuels, the availability of CPO in an\nincreasingly crowded refining industry, production variability due to weather, and supply challenges\nthroughout the archipelago. As a result, 2017 consumption is forecasted to remain on track with 2016\nconsumption.\nTrade\nIndonesian biodiesel exports have fallen for three consecutive years as demand in China and Europe\ndried up due to the increasing competitiveness of fossil fuels and changes in duties. In 2014 exports fell\nfrom 1.7 to 1.3 billion liters, and 2015 exports further dropped to 341 million liters. As a result of the\nexpectation that (despite some recovery in oil prices) biodiesel will remain less competitive with fossil\ndiesel, Post expects that Indonesia’s biodiesel exports will continue to fall, estimated at 200 million\nliters in 2016 and 100 million liters in 2017.\nFigure 2.

Ethanol\nProduction\nIndonesia has virtually no fuel grade ethanol (FGE) production, having ended their fuel ethanol blending\nprogram in 2010. Ethanol industry contacts (including Pertamina representatives) explain that FGE\ndistribution was ended due to inconsistent supply and price volatility, and that the price offered by\nPertamina was too low. Post notes that under the former program, bioethanol prices were set by MEMR\nand based on the Argus average ethanol price, frequently resulting in a purchase price below cost of\nproduction.\nFigure 3. Indonesian Bioethanol Index Price vs Gasoline Price (IDR per liter)\n\nSource: MEMR\n\nIndonesia is home to more than 50 sugarcane mills, providing a readily available supply of molasses for\nethanol feedstock. Indonesia thus primarily manufactures molasses-based ethanol, although a small\nquantity is refined from cassava. According to FAS estimates, (see GAIN Report ID1614), Indonesian\nsugarcane production reached 27.1 MMT in 2014/15 and is expected to increase to 28 MMT in 2015/16\nand 2016/17. Post thus expects molasses production to reach 1.4 MMT in 2016, assuming that sugarcane\ncan yield 5 to 6 percent molasses.\nIndonesia uses molasses for non-fuel ethanol, amino acid and monosodium glutamate production, and\nfor export. Under normal conditions, Indonesia typically exports 33 percent of its molasses production,\nan expected 441 thousand MT in 2015 and 2016 (see Figure 4). Amino acid/monosodium glutamate\ntypically consumes 20 to 30 percent of Indonesia’s molasses production, while the remainder is used to\nproduce non-fuel ethanol. Non-fuel ethanol applications include pharmacy and hospital products,\ncosmetics, perfume, and tobacco products. It is also used in the manufacture of acetic acid, ethyl acetate,\nand methylated spirit.\n\n\u000cFigure 4 Indonesia molasses exports 2010-2015 (metric ton, HS code: 1703)\n\nSource: GTIS\n\nIndonesia’s ethanol refinery capacity has fluctuated since 2007. While its most recent ethanol plant was\ncommissioned in 2014, at least three plants closed between 2008 and 2013. Based on MEMR and\nassociation data, Post counts 14 ethanol plants, (operational and idle) with total capacity at 408 thousand\nKL a year. Only 3 out of 14 plants can produce FGE, with total FGE capacity at 100 thousand KL per\nyear.\nBased on the molasses production estimate and the above factors, post expects that Indonesian ethanol\nproduction will increase from 205 million liters in 2015 to 207 million liters in 2016.\nConsumption\nThere has not been significant FGE consumption since the end of Indonesia’s FGE blending program in\nin 2010.\nIndustrial ethanol is mainly used in products including perfumes, cosmetics, pharmaceutical goods and\nother chemical solvents. Industry contacts confirm that non-fuel ethanol demand is stagnant. Post thus\nexpects ethanol consumption to reach 136 million liters in 2016, with consumption coming from the\nperfume, cosmetic, pharmacy and chemical solvent industries.\nTrade\nIndustrial ethanol (IGE) exports registered a 29 percent drop in 2015, from 94 to 67 million liters. IGE\nexports are expected to reach approximately 60 million liters in both 2016 and 2017. January and\nFebruary 2016 trade data shows Indonesia is on track to meet this target, having reached 11 million liters\nof export, or 18 percent of the total forecasted exports.\nStocks\nPost expects that ethanol stocks will grow slightly based on expected increasing production and stagnant\nconsumption. 2017 stocks are thus expected to reach 36 million liters.\n\n\u000cProduction, Supply and Demand Statistics\nEthanol Used as Fuel and Other Industrial Chemicals (Million Liters)\nCalendar Year\nBeginning\nStocks\nFuel Begin\nStocks\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n33\n\n31\n\n42\n\n36\n\n40\n\n50\n\n37\n\n11\n\n14\n\n25\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n169\n\n172\n\n175\n\n200\n\n205\n\n207\n\n202\n\n205\n\n207\n\n207\n\n1\n\n1.7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n47\n\n33\n\n49\n\n63\n\n59\n\n86\n\n94\n\n67\n\n60\n\n60\n\nFuel Exports\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nConsumption\nFuel\nConsumption\n\n124\n\n128\n\n132\n\n134\n\n135\n\n135\n\n135\n\n136\n\n136\n\n136\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nEnding Stocks\nFuel Ending\nStocks\nTotal Balance\nCheck\nFuel Balance\nCheck\n\n31\n\n42\n\n36\n\n40\n\n50\n\n37\n\n11\n\n14\n\n25\n\n36\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nProduction Capacity\nNumber of\nRefineries\n13\nNameplate\nCapacity\n258\n\n12\n\n14\n\n14\n\n15\n\n15\n\n13\n\n14\n\n14\n\n14\n\n288\n\n342\n\n392\n\n392\n\n378\n\n408\n\n408\n\n408\n\n408\n\n60%\n\n51%\n\n51%\n\n52%\n\n55%\n\n50%\n\n50%\n\n51%\n\n51%\n\n700\n\n800\n\n820\n\n828\n\n808\n\n820\n\n828\n\n828\n\nProduction\nFuel Production\nImports\nFuel Imports\nExports\n\nCapacity Use (%)\n\n66%\n\nFeedstock Use for Fuel (1,000 MT)\nMolasses\n\n676\n\n688\n\nMarket Penetration (Million Liters)\nFuel Ethanol\nGasoline\nBlend Rate (%)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20,11\n5\n\n22,07\n3\n\n23,92\n6\n\n26,53\n1\n\n29,27\n8\n\n30,51\n4\n\n30,92\n6\n\n32,62\n7\n\n34,42\n2\n\n35,48\n1\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\nVI Advanced Biofuels\nIndonesia biofuel industry is uniquely focused on CPO-based biodiesel.

The tenders will consist of 2.9 million metric tons of food-grade rice, of which 2.2 million\nmetric tons will be exclusively for export, and 0.7 million metric tons for domestic or export\nmarket. Most of the stocks are 5% grade and broken white rice (A1 Super grade) from carry-over\nstocks under the MY2012/13 and MY2013/14 rice pledging programs.

According to\nCAPMAS, one of the key drivers was food prices, increasing by 2.1 month-over-month. Restrictive\nmeasures on grain and soybean imports have contributed to higher food prices in Egypt.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nEGYPT’S HIGHER FOOD PRICES CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING INFLATION\nOn July 10, 2016, a CAPMAS report stated that the CPI for the month of June increased 0.78 percent\nfrom May, a slowdown from May’s monthly increase of 3.05 percent from April, which was the\nlargest monthly increase since July of 2014. In both cases the key drivers were food prices,\nincreasing 3.8 percent and 2.1 percent in May and June, respectively.\nAs a result, with the latest June numbers, despite attempts to control inflation, the official annualized\nrate reached a seven year high of 13.97 percent. On June 16, the Central Bank, reacting to May’s\nincreasing inflation, again raised interest rates by 100 basis points, hiking the overnight deposit rate\nto 11.75 percent. In its press release announcing the interest rate increase, the Central Bank stated\nthat it needed to curb medium term inflation due to “…regulated price adjustments which contributed\n0.4 percentage points, supply shocks such as the increase in rice prices which contributed by 0.5\npercentage points, seasonal effects of the holy month of Ramadan, and a lagged pass-through effect\nfrom the March 14, 2016 exchange rate adjustment. [sic]”\nSUPPLY SHOCKS\nPart of the supply shocks have been caused by the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation’s\nCentral Administration for Plant Quarantine’s (CAPQ) agricultural import measures (see June 2016\nreport) and the Central Bank’s efforts to address its foreign exchange shortfall, which have helped\ncause distortions in the Egyptian food market at a time of low global commodity pricing. Figure 1\nillustrates global decreases in food prices, as demonstrated by FAO’s Food Price Index.\n\nIn North Africa, Egypt is in a unique situation, as its domestic food prices have risen despite the\nglobal decrease in food prices. The downward trend in food prices accelerated in 2015, diverging\nsignificantly from its North African neighbors (Figure 2) that face similar sufficiency challenges in\nkey commodities (Figure 3). From January 2015 to April of 2016, Egypt’s North African neighbors\n\n\u000chave been able to maintain food inflation below six percent, in the same period Egypt’s food\ninflation soared to 27 percent. Much of the increase in Egypt’s food prices has been caused by\nforeign exchange shortages that led to an official devaluation of the Egyptian pound in March and a\nmuch-higher exchange rate in the parallel Egyptian pound market. Since Egypt imports 60 percent of\nits food requirements, Egyptian customers have had to pay more for much of the food they consume.\n\nAdditional Drivers of Higher Food Prices\nWheat\nIn December of 2015, Egypt’s Central Administration for Quarantine (CAPQ) rejected a 63,000 MT\nshipment of French wheat due to the presence of ergot fungus. The shipment was rejected despite\nhaving ergot levels below the 0.05 percent threshold stipulated in Egyptian and international wheat\nstandards. This was the first time that Egypt’s CAPQ rejected a wheat shipment on the premise of\nzero tolerance for ergot.\nThis decision rattled world grain markets, with a-larger-than-expected spillover in Egypt’s domestic\n\n\u000cmarket. Figure 4 highlights how CAPQ’s actions decoupled Egypt’s domestic price from the world\nprice. Usually the wheat price differential includes transport fees and costs due to specification and\ninspection requirements, as well as the domestic support price. However, after the December\nrejection, the domestic market price reflected a premium that traders are now charging Egypt in order\nto hedge against the uncertainty caused by CAPQ’s new policy stance. The spread in world market\nprices and domestic prices went from an average of $40/MT to a range of $80-110/MT.\n\nEgypt would be hard-pressed to import ergot-free wheat which is present in 66 countries, including\nall the major exporters: Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and the\nUnited States. As a result of the Prime Minister’s intervention in June 2016 on this issue, it appears\nthat Egypt will abide by the aforementioned internationally-accepted ergot tolerance level of 0.05\npercent.\nFigure 5: Claviceps purpurea distribution\n\nSource: CABI\n\n\u000cCorn\nEgypt’s relies on imported corn to meet 60 percent of its consumption needs; however, its animal\nproduction sector relies on imported corn to meet more than 90 percent of their requirements. Any\nprice movement in corn directly impacts key domestic products that account for the bulk of the\nconsumption demands of Egypt’s consumers. These include poultry, dairy, eggs, fish and breakfast\ncereals.\nCorn imports have been affected by the shortage of foreign exchange and CAPQ’s restrictive\nmeasures. Despite being a commodity on the Central Bank’s priority list, corn traders and importers\nhave struggled to obtain forex to conduct business. Consequently, they have been pressed to source\nforex in the parallel market at a premium of 15-30 percent. In December 2015, domestic corn prices\nsurged significantly when CAPQ rejected soybean and wheat shipments due to Ambrosia spp. and\nergot findings. The corn industry reacted swiftly by charging a risk-premium on imported corn,\nfearing that they would also suffer from CAPQ’s new policy approach. Figure 6 illustrates the surge\nin the spread between international and domestic prices, escalating from $50/MT to $120/MT with\nan all-time high in January of 2016 of $160/MT.\n\nSoybeans\nEgypt is 100 percent dependent on soybean imports, and soy is the commodity that has been hit the\nhardest by CAPQ’s stringent application of new regulatory standards. Egypt’s expanding and once\nthriving soybean crushing industry has incurred enormous losses as it has reduced its soybean\nsourcing due to a growing number of rejected shipments on Ambrosia spp. concerns. The rejected\nshipments have forced the country to increase its forex spending on much needed soybean meal and\nsoybean oil products (Figure 7), rather than produce them domestically using imported soybeans,\nwhich add value domestically.\n\n\u000cRisks associated with Ambrosia spp. are mitigated when soybeans are crushed and processed, a\nmeasure widely accepted by much larger importing nations including China, the EU, Japan and\nMexico. Should CAPQ continue rejecting soybean shipments, Egypt will import close to one million\nmetric tons (MMT) of additional soybean meal, paying a premium of $60/MT (Figure 8) or $60\nmillion in 2016 alone.\n\n\u000cIn addition to the loss of value addition and increasing foreign exchange expenditures, the domestic\nprice of soybeans in Egypt has increased disproportionally to world soybean prices. Traders and end\nusers need to access forex at a significant premium in the parallel market, and suppliers factor in the\nrisk premium due to CAPQ’s practices. The spread between domestic and international prices has\nsurged from an average of $120 to an average of $320 (Figure 9).\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Grain and Feed Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-18-2016.txt\nCrop update - France weighs heavy on otherwise positive prospects_London_United Kingdom EU-27_7-20-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-28-2016.txt\nNile Nuggets for July 2016_Cairo_Egypt_7-24-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-21-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_7-15-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nMinistry of Agriculture Paves the Way for US Corn Imports_Brasilia_Brazil_8-4-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_New Delhi_India_7-28-2016.txt\nOilseeds Market Update_Vienna_EU-28_8-3-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nBrazil Agricultural Economic Factsheet_Brasilia_Brazil_7-25-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Dhaka_Bangladesh_8-5-2016.txt\nStone Fruit Report 2016_Berlin_Germany_7-21-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Update_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_7-29-2016.txt\n","title":"EGYPT%80%99S INCREASING FOOD PRICES DRIVING HIGHER INFLATION _Cairo_Egypt_8-4-2016.txt","summary":"measures on grain and soybean imports have contributed to higher food prices in Egypt.\nEGYPT’S HIGHER FOOD PRICES CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING INFLATION\nOn July 10, 2016, a CAPMAS report stated that the CPI for the month of June increased 0.78 percent\ncause distortions in the Egyptian food market at a time of low global commodity pricing.\nFigure 4 highlights how CAPQ’s actions decoupled Egypt’s domestic price from the world\nrejection, the domestic market price reflected a premium that traders are now charging Egypt in order\nShould CAPQ continue rejecting soybean shipments, Egypt will import close to one million","keywords":"prices price pricing egypt","latentTopics":"egypt, percent, prices, domestic, figure, corn, capq, june, soybean, central"}

Post further forecasts China’s 2017 production to drop by 1.9 MMT, or\napproximately 14 percent, from CY 2015 figures if restrictions continue.\nAccording to China Customs data, China imported\nnearly $40 million of chicks used for breeding stock in\n2014, of which over 90 percent originated from the\nUnited States. In 2015, after the highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza (HPAI)-related restrictions were put in place;\nChina imported only $22 million worth of chicks and is\nforecast to again import only half of the 2014 figure this\nyear.\nPrior to 2015, the United States and France were\nChina’s top suppliers of white-feathered broiler\ngrandparent stock. Shipments are currently restricted\nfrom both countries due to avian influenza concerns. As\na result, supplies have increased from Spain and New\n\nUnited States Poultry Restricted\nChina has restricted all U.S.-origin\npoultry and poultry products since\nJanuary 2015 in direct response to\nDecember 2014 HPAI outbreaks in\nthe United States. As of August 1,\n2016, China has not removed\nrestrictions on U.S. poultry and\npoultry products even though the\nUnited States has been recognized by\nthe World Organization for Animal\nHealth (OIE) as free of HPAI since\nApril 22, 2016.\nThe United States supplied over 90\npercent of China’s imported chicks\nused for breeding stock in 2014.\n\n\u000cZealand but these shipments have only partially offset large import declines. With import restrictions on\nthe top suppliers for most of 2015, and most likely all of 2016, industry sources have expressed concern\nthat existing grandparent stocks will not be able to maintain current production levels in 2016 and will\ngreatly affect 2017 production levels.\nTable 2: Declining imports of white broiler grandparent stock\nChina White Broiler Breeder Imports\n2014\n1.7 million units\n2015\n694,000 units\n2016\n400,000 units (estimate)\nSource: Industry Source\n\nThe reduction in grandparent stock has led China’s poultry industry to further use a practice known as\nforced-molting. The expected outcome of forced-molting is to increase egg production, and therefore\nprofitability of flocks, in the broilers’ second laying phases. China’s poultry producers use the practice\nto extend production of the limited white-feathered broilers currently in the production system. The\npractice of forced-molting is not prevalent in other countries because of animal rights concerns as well\nas concerns over increased mortality rates in laying phases beyond the second phase. While the practice\nof forced-molting is forecast to somewhat offset the reduction in China’s production output of poultry\nmeat in 2016, industry sources believe the offset will be minimal and only a short-term solution.\nThe Chinese poultry industry has grown over recent years, adding many new slaughtering facilities in\nthe provinces of Shandong and Liaoning. Though, due to the reduction in available birds, these facilities\nare not operating at full capacity. Fujian Sunner Group continues to be the number one broiler meat\nproducer in China with an annual harvest of roughly 400 million birds, or 648–840 TTM per year.\nFujian Sunner Group’s production represents about 5-7 percent of China’s total production in 2016.\nIn addition to improved food safety surveillance systems, the Chinese poultry industry has also\nenhanced farm management and feed nutrition. China’s broiler production industry is now considered a\nmature market and China’s metrics for measuring efficiency are similar to other mature markets (e.g.,\nUnited States). The average weight of fully grown broilers at slaughter is currently at 2.5 kilograms (kg)\nper bird. Average feed conversion ratio (FCR) is approximately 1.7:1 to 1.8:1kg per bird. Both of these\nfigures are in line with global industry averages.\nProduction Costs\nIn line with lower global price trends, domestic prices for corn in the first 7 months of 2016 (JanuaryJuly) slid by approximately 16 percent to 2044 RMB/MT as compared to the same period of 2015. The\ndrop in prices is a result of abundant supply after China’s record corn production in 2015 and the\nelimination of government support prices in 2016. Meanwhile, prices for fishmeal have stabilized after a\npeak in 2015. On average, China continues to import about 1 MMT per year. While fishmeal has been\nreported to have been used in feed at some broiler production facilities, the majority of fishmeal\ncontinues to go towards aquaculture feed and some use in the pork industry. In comparison, China’s\ndomestic prices for soybean meal have increased in comparison to the same period last year. In the last\ntwo months of available data (i.e., June and July 2016) prices of soybean meal have increased by\n\n\u000capproximately 15 percent. Despite recent soybean price increases, trade sources report that Chinese feed\nmills have maintained their feed rations in favor of soybean meal.\nIndustry sources report prices of parent broiler stock increasing roughly 3 times that of the prices of\nparent stock during the same period in 2015.\nTable 3: Wholesale Prices for Feed Ingredients (RMB/kg)\n\nMonth\n\n2015\n\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\n\n2.43\n2.41\n2.42\n2.44\n2.46\n2.47\n2.47\n2.46\n2.37\n2.22\n2.13\n2.14\n\nCorn\n2016\n2.10\n2.09\n2.04\n1.98\n1.97\n2.03\n2.10\n\n%∆\n-13.58%\n-13.28%\n-15.70%\n-18.85%\n-19.92%\n-17.81%\n-14.98%\n\nSoybean Meal\n2015\n2016\n%∆\n3.73\n3.60\n3.59\n3.54\n3.47\n3.33\n3.31\n3.30\n3.25\n3.23\n3.18\n3.10\n\n3.08\n3.10\n3.03\n2.97\n3.08\n3.35\n3.54\n\n-17.43%\n-13.89%\n-15.60%\n-16.10%\n-11.24%\n0.60%\n6.95%\n\nAverage\n2.37\n2.04\n-16.30%\n3.39\n3.16\nSource: China Ministry of Agriculture\nNote: US$1.00 = 6.68 RMB as of July 25, 2016\n\n-9.53%\n\nConsumption\nAs supply for broiler meat tightens, prices will increase, and consumption will decrease. Post forecasts\nconsumption to fall in 2016 to approximately 12.64 MMT and to 11.60 MMT in 2017. USDA official\nconsumption numbers for 2015 were 13.27 MMT. Post’s forecasts for 2016 and 2017 represent a\ndecrease of 5 and 13 percent from the 2015 figure, respectively.\nWhile China’s domestic pork prices are expected to continue rising, broiler prices are also expected to\nrise. Consumption of white-feathered broiler meat (i.e., broilers imported from the Western countries)\nwill vary across the country. White broilers are commonly used in fast food restaurants (e.g., Kentucky\nFried Chicken) and in processed products because of the white-feathered broilers cost competitiveness\nin comparison to yellow-feathered broilers. White-feathered broilers are approximately half the price of\nthe yellow-feathered broilers, which are sourced locally.\n\nComparison between White Feathered and Yellow Feathered Chickens\n\n\u000cSpecies\nMarket share in\n2016*\nFeed to meat\nratio\nSales channel\n\nWhite Feathered Broiler\n90% grandparent stocks imported from\nthe United States\n48%\n\nYellow Feathered Broiler\nLocal species\n\n1.7:1 to 1.8:1 kg\n\n2.5:1 kg\n\nFast food restaurants, canteens and food\nprocessing plants\n\nWet markets and supermarkets; targeting\nfamily consumption\n\n31%\n\nChicken wings and legs are popular consumer products throughout China.

While domestically sourced yellow-feathered broilers will not be able to meet demand created by\ndecreasing white-feathered broiler supply, yellow-feathered broilers are expected to increase market\nshare in 2017. Post forecasts market share for white-feathered broilers to drop to 48 percent in 2016.\nThe drop represents a decrease of 7 percent from February forecasts.\nAverage retail prices for broiler meat increased by 1.1% percent to 19.2 RMB/kg in 2016 (January-May)\nfrom 18.9 RMB/kg during the same period in 2015.\nTrade\nExport\nGraph 1: Broiler Meat Exports 2012 – Current.\n\nChina’s broiler meat exports decreased by nearly 7 percent in CY 2015 to 401 thousand metric tons\n(TMT). For comparison, the United States exported roughly 3.1 MMT in 2015. During the first 6\nmonths of 2016, China’s exports have increased by 2 percent in comparison with the same period in\n2015. This slight increase in the first half of 2016 is due to China’s competiveness in the fresh/chilled\nmarket in Hong Kong and the preference in Hong Kong for yellow-feathered broiler meat. Post\nforecasts overall exports to decline 5.2 percent in CY 2017 to 380 TMT as a result of the decreased\nsupply of grandparent stock and the forecasted increase in prices.\n\n\u000cChina continues to be the fifth largest broiler meat exporter to the world after Brazil, the United States,\nthe EU, and Thailand. Thailand is the fourth largest exporter of broiler meat with approximately 622\nTMT of exports in 2015, over 200 TMT more than China. Japan, Hong Kong, and Malaysia are the top\nmarkets for China, accounting for more than 80 percent of China’s exports, or about 340 TMT in 2015.\nExport Trend\nThe Chinese consumer has a strong preference for chicken wings and legs. Breast meat, on the other\nhand, is not preferred. As China’s capacity to manage the production and processing of broiler meat\ngrows, China could become a large exporter of white breast meat. Currently, the major export market\nfor China’s prepared or preserved broiler meat products is Japan. Thailand is also a major producer of\nthe prepared or preserved broiler meat products and is China’s leading competitor in Japan.\nFresh/chilled whole birds are largely exported to Hong Kong. The United States and Brazil are major\ncompetitors in the Hong Kong fresh/chilled market.\nJapan is China’s largest export market, accounting for nearly half of all exports for the last 5 years.\nRecently, however, China’s exports to Japan have been declining as a result of the 2014 food safety\nscandal involving a major global supplier. Since then, industry has reported that Japan has increased\nimports from Thailand. Post forecasts next year’s exports to Japan to continue to decrease due to the\nreduction in domestic production, increased prices, and lingering food safety concerns.\nImport\n\nAs a result of the United States’ avian influenza restrictions, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile have all\nincreased exports of broiler meat to China. China’s imports increased by nearly 3 percent in CY 2015 to\n268 TMT (for comparison, the United States imported roughly 50 TMT in 2015). During the first 6\nmonths of 2016, China’s imports have increased by over a third in comparison with the same period in\n2015. This sharp increase in the first half of 2016 is due to the inability of China to meet demand\n\n\u000cdomestically. Post forecasts imports to increase over 200 TMT from 2015 figures in CY 2017 to 480\nTMT as a result of the decline in Chinese production.\nBrazil has been able to increase broiler meat exports to China by more than 60 percent over the last two\nyears. This is a result of many additional Brazilian factories being approved to export to China and the\ndepreciation of the Real. Brazilian exports of broiler meat to China now account for approximately three\nquarters of total Chinese imports.\nPost adjusted China’s 2016 imports down to 350 TMT, which is about a 31 percent increase from 2015\nfigures. The adjustment is mainly due to lackluster consumption and reduced exports.\nImport Policy\nChina imposes avian influenza (AI) related import restrictions that are inconsistent with the World\nOrganization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines. China requires countries to be free of both highly\npathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) for 90 days before\nsubmitting an application to get the AI restriction lifted. The OIE, on the other hand, recommends\ncountries to be free of only HPAI. Once a country is free of AI, China’s application process to lift the\nrestriction is time intensive and non-transparent. For example, the United States has been requesting\nremoval of the restriction since April 22, 2016 (i.e., the day the United States became recognized by the\nOIE as free of HPAI) but China has yet to recognize the United States’ status (Accurate as of August 1,\n2016). Furthermore, China continues to implement country-wide restrictions rather than the OIE\nrecommended regionalization (or zoning) method. Regionalization is a way to restrict trade from certain\nregions (or zones) rather than from an entire country. For geographically large countries like the United\nStates, Canada, and France (and China), regionalization is an important policy to ensuring fair and\nequitable trade.\nChina also has anti-dumping duties on U.S. poultry and poultry products. In 2013, the WTO found that\nChina's imposition of higher duties on chicken broiler products – which was followed by an 80 percent\ndrop in American exports of those products to China – is unjustified under international trade rules. The\ndispute settlement process for this case is ongoing.\n\n\u000cPrice Table (based on RMB/KG, $1=RMB6.5)\nChina Retail Broiler Meat Prices on Average,\n2011-2016\n\n(RMB /KG)\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\nSource: The Ministry of Agriculture collected\nfrom over 400 markets of farm produce.\n\n20\n11\n16.\n32\n16.\n71\n16.\n33\n16.\n32\n16.\n45\n16.\n95\n17.\n49\n17.\n94\n18.\n05\n18.\n00\n17.\n57\n17.\n39\n\n20\n12\n17.\n65\n17.\n46\n17.\n04\n16.\n99\n16.\n73\n16.\n74\n16.\n71\n16.\n90\n17.\n28\n17.\n43\n17.\n50\n17.\n70\n\n20\n13\n17.\n92\n18.\n41\n17.\n90\n16.\n39\n15.\n32\n16.\n00\n16.\n40\n16.\n89\n17.\n33\n17.\n45\n17.\n40\n17.\n51\n\n20\n14\n17.\n55\n17.\n15\n16.\n83\n17.\n15\n17.\n93\n18.\n22\n18.\n32\n18.\n78\n19.\n16\n19.\n22\n19.\n14\n19.\n06\n\n20\n15\n19.\n09\n19.\n28\n19.\n08\n18.\n73\n18.\n56\n18.\n43\n18.\n65\n19.\n10\n19.\n25\n18.\n95\n18.\n82\n18.\n96\n\n20\n16\n19.\n05\n19.\n50\n19.\n13\n19.\n05\n19.\n11\n\nPerce\nnt\nChan\nge\n2015/\n2016\n-0.2%\n1.1%\n0.3%\n1.7%\n3.0%\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Poultry and Products Annual_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nPoultry and Products Annual_Ottawa_Canada_8-4-2016.txt\nFAS Canada Assists Small U.S. Exporter_Toronto_Canada_7-19-2016.txt\nStrong Results at Vinexpo Hong Kong 2016 for U.S. Wines_Hong Kong_Hong Kong_7-20-2016.txt\nParliament to Study Duty Deferral Program -Milk and Poultry Trade_Ottawa_Canada_8-9-2016.txt\nBrazil Agricultural Economic Factsheet_Brasilia_Brazil_7-25-2016.txt\nMinistry of Agriculture Paves the Way for US Corn Imports_Brasilia_Brazil_8-4-2016.txt\n2016 Potato Update_Seoul_Korea - Republic of_7-22-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nPork - 2016_New Delhi_India_7-21-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\n2016 Seafood Products Market Brief_Seoul ATO_Korea - Republic of_8-2-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-28-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Annual 2016_Dakar_Senegal_7-19-2016.txt\nThe Netherlands Horticulture Market_The Hague_Netherlands_8-3-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nOilseeds and Products Update_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_7-29-2016.txt\n","title":"Poultry and Products Annual_Beijing_China - Peoples Republic of_8-2-2016.txt","summary":"Post forecasts China’s 2017 broiler meat consumption to be 11.6 million metric tons (MMT), a 13\nChinese broiler meat production is forecast to drop by approximately 0.7 million metric tons (MMT), or\nAverage retail prices for broiler meat increased by 1.1% percent to 19.2 RMB/kg in 2016 (January-May)\nChina’s broiler meat exports decreased by nearly 7 percent in CY 2015 to 401 thousand metric tons\nChina continues to be the fifth largest broiler meat exporter to the world after Brazil, the United States,\nBrazil has been able to increase broiler meat exports to China by more than 60 percent over the last two","keywords":"china products production broiler broilers","latentTopics":"china, broiler, percent, exports, meat, post, united, states, feathered, poultry"}

Sultana raisin exports are also forecasted to increase to 220,000 MT in MY 2016/17 up\nfrom 193,460 MT in MY 2015/16.\n\n\u000cExecutive Summary:\nThis report focuses specifically on sultana raisins, which are a dried seedless grape variety indigenous to\nthe Izmir region of Turkey and grown mostly in the regions of Manisa and Izmir.\nThe Turkish Raisin Production Forecast Commission has members from the Izmir Commodity\nExchange, Izmir Chamber of Commerce, Manisa Commodity Exchange, Alasehir Commodity\nExchange, Aegean Exporters Union and the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock (MinFAL)\nGrape Research Center. This Commission visits certain vineyards in late July to forecast the production\nof the upcoming marketing year.\nPost expects the sultana raisin production in the Aegean region, which accounts for virtually all\nproduction, to be 300,000 MT from a planted area of 105,000 hectares (roughly 259,000 acres).\nIn MY 2016/17, the weather was favorable apart from the brief rise in temperatures in mid-June, which\nresulted in sunburns in some vineyards. Raisin production in MY 2016/17 is expected to be 300,000\nMT. The European Union (EU) is the top export destination for Turkish raisins receiving an average of\n80 percent of all Turkish raisin exports. United Kingdom (UK) is the leading export destination,\nreceiving around 50 percent of all Turkish exports. UK is followed by Germany, the Netherlands, Italy\nand Australia.\nIn January 2016, EU published a directive stating that the chlorpyrifos residue limit (a pesticide used\nagainst grapevine moth) shall be reduced from 0.5 ppm to 0.01 ppm beginning from August 10, 2016.\nThis resulted in an unexpected decrease in raisin prices despite low yields in MY 2015/16. The prices\nof raisins dropped from 5.5 TL/kg in August 2015 to below 4 TL/kg in February 2016.\nIf Russia does not lift import sanctions against Turkey within the next few months, fresh grape exports\nthat would normally be exported to Russia would turn into raisins, which would reflect as a 15 - 20,000\nMT of increase in raisin production.\n\nCommodities:\nRaisins\nProduction:\nTurkey is generally the world’s second largest raisin producer after the United States and the leading\nexporter. Grapes are grown throughout Turkey, and there are more than 1,200 different grape varieties\nin Turkey. Turkey produces approximately 4 MMT of grapes annually. While the Aegean region\nproduces seedless grapes, the Marmara, Central Anatolia and Southeast Anatolia regions produce table\nand wine grapes.\nTable grapes make up approximately 30 percent of the production, drying grapes make up 35 percent,\ngrapes for traditional products such as molasses (pekmez) make up 25 percent, and grapes used for\nalcoholic beverage production make up approximately 10 percent of this total.\n\n\u000cHarvest season starts around August 15, so the marketing years in this report refer to the period between\nSeptember 1st of the first year until August 30th of the next year.\nSeedless grape production expanded significantly in Turkey in the 1990s due to more intensive\ncultivation and adoption of better irrigation techniques. Seedless grape production is about 1.5 million\nMT, which constitutes around 40 percent of Turkey’s total grape crop and are grown only in the Aegean\n(western) part of Turkey. Twenty percent of this production is consumed as fresh and the rest is dried.\nWhen dried, approximately 4 kg of grapes result in 1 kg of raisins.\nThe Sultana Raisins Association, which was established in 1934, formed the basis of “Raisins\nAgricultural Sales Cooperatives Union - TARIS”. Generally, TARIS purchases around 15-20 percent of\ntotal production. The cooperatives of the union are spread across the Aegean Region, located in the\nwestern part of Turkey. The vineyards of TARIS members have always set a good example in the\nregion regarding the yield and the quality of the product.\nThe size of an average farm is less than 3 hectares in Turkey. Therefore, as like other commodities,\nseedless grapes are generally grown on small farms averaging about 1.3 hectares. It is estimated that\nnearly 65,000 growers produce seedless grapes in Turkey, and about half of all raisin producers are\nmembers of TARIS. Each year TARIS announces a procurement price for raisins, which also serves as a\nsupport price. TARIS is required to buy raisins from its members but members are free to sell to other\nbuyers and they often do.\nThe pictures below show the state of some vineyards around Manisa during the week of July 18, 2016.\n\n\u000cConsumption:\nDespite Turkey’s leading role in the production of raisins, domestic consumption is comparatively low.\nMost of the production (generally around 80 percent) is exported. Direct human consumption is around\n20-25,000 MT and the industry consumption (for cakes, biscuits and snacks) is about the same amount\nwhich account to a total of 45,000 – 50,000 MT. The reason for low domestic consumption is that\ngrapes are mostly consumed as fresh in the season and there are many grape alternatives grown\nthroughout the country. Raisins are generally consumed when there are no fresh grapes around. As for\nthe industry, raisins are used in some cakes, biscuits and as chocolate covered snacks, but their\nconsumption is limited.\nThe alcoholic beverages sector (lead by raki - a strong anise based Turkish alcoholic drink, and\nfollowed by wine and brandy) generally uses fresh grapes but also uses low quality raisins when there is\nexcess supply. An average of 20,000 MT of raisins go into the raki industry annually.\nThe alcohol legislation passed in 1942 and amended in 2013, along with several tax increases, has\neffectively made it more difficult and expensive to buy or sell alcohol in Turkey. Alcohol legislation\nhad been tightened gradually since the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in the early\n2000s, with the strictest rules introduced in 2013. The raki industry usually requires 350,000 MT of\ngrapes, and the brandy and wine industries require about 80,000 MT of grapes annually, and the wine\ngrape production barely meets this demand.\nTrade:\nAlthough there are numerous firms in the dried fruit processing and export business in Turkey, the top\nten firms are estimated to control about 80 percent of the raisin market.\n\n\u000cTARIS’s role in procuring and marketing raisins has been decreasing in conjunction with International\nMonetary Fund (IMF)-backed reforms to reduce the government’s role in agriculture. In general,\nTARIS has been the buyer of last resort, purchasing a large percentage of lower quality raisins. The\nquantity of raisins TARIS procured has varied from as low as 9,000 MT to as high as 75,000 MT during\nthe last ten years due to variable production levels and quality.\nTARIS and the Izmir Commodity Exchange are the two price determinants in the market. The former\nannounces the advance procurement prices in the beginning of the season and the latter is the main cash\nmarket for raisins.\nEU countries continue to be the top export destinations for Turkish raisins, accounting for 80 percent of\nTurkey’s raisin exports. The United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands continue to be the top\nthree importers of Turkish raisins. After the decrease in production in MY 2015/16, Post expects a\nrecovery in the amount of exports to 220,000 MT in MY 2016/17.\nRussia started to impose sanctions on Turkish imports following the downing of a Russian plane in\nNovember, 2015. Fresh grapes cannot be exported to Russia under the sanctions. If Russia does not lift\nimport sanctions against Turkey soon, fresh grape exports that would normally be exported to Russia\nwould turn into raisins, which would reflect as a 15 - 20,000 MT of increase in raisin production.\nIn MY2015/16, low yields reflected as an increase in prices initially. However, in January 2016 the\nEuropean Union published a regulation for the decrease in chloropyrifos levels from 0.5 ppm to 0.01\nppm beginning from August 10, 2016. This resulted in a panic in the industry and the prices started to\ndrop. Following this regulation, Turkey banned the use of this pesticide in March 2016. As a result,\neven though the issue has been resolved, the prices remained at the same levels with the expectation of a\ngood crop in MY 2016/17.\nCurrently raisins are traded at 3.40 – 4.00 TL/kg at the Izmir Commodity Exchange (1 US$ = 3 TL as of\nthe date of this report).

While members of the committee have been paying surprise visits to silos to monitor the\nquantities and quality of the wheat delivered, they confirmed evidence that there was false reporting of\nthe delivered quantities. The committee announced that there were discrepancies between the quantities\nlisted in registers and the actual quantities in the silos. Between 40 and 50 percent of the wheat recorded\nwas missing from some silos inspected. Silo owners are paid by the government for the reported volume\npurchased. By registering quantities higher than the amounts actually delivered, the owners of the silos\npocket the difference in payment. In cases where fraud was uncovered, the missing quantities could be\nmade up with cheaper imported wheat, allowing the owners to still earn the difference between the\ndomestic and international prices (currently near US$145/MT). The committee said it will continue the\ninvestigation and send the whole case to the Egyptian General Prosecutor for investigations.\nEGYPT REJECTS U.S WHEAT SHIPMENT DUE TO ERGOT CONTAMINATION: Egypt’s\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation’s Central Administration for Plant Quarantine (CAPQ)\nissued the final rejection of a shipment of 33,000 metric tons of wheat from the US. The agency alleged\nthat the shipment had levels of ergot fungus that breached international and local wheat standards. In a\nstatement on Thursday, July 21, Agriculture Minister, Dr. Essam Fayed, said that a sample from the\nshipment showed 0.096 percent ergot, well in excess of the internationally accepted level of 0.05\npercent. CAPQ’s test results of 0.096 percent ergot contradict with the Ministry of Health’s results for\nthe same sample, which showed 0.006 percent ergot contamination, well below the permissible level.\nCAPQ refused a request for additional sampling in order to verify the contradicting results. The level of\nergot fungus in wheat shipments has been an ongoing cause for controversy in Egypt as CAPQ was\ninsisting on a zero-tolerance policy for ergot in wheat shipments. A new ministerial decree issued in July\n2016 accepted the 0.05 percent level.\nEGYPT REFUSED EU DEMANDS TO LIFT IMPORT RESTRICTIONS: Egypt has refused EU\ndemands to lift the facility registration requirement for foreign firms exporting to Egypt. The European\nUnion held meetings with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to discuss the negative impacts of the\nnew policy as it restricts trade between the two parties, James Moran, EU ambassador to Egypt, told\nlocal media. However, Egypt’s Minister of Trade and Industry said that the import policies introduced\nfollow WTO regulations. He explained that the ministry informed the WTO before making the decision,\nand that the ministry is ready to deal with any escalations from the EU. He told reporters that Egypt has\nthe right to take all the necessary legal actions required to protect its economy and regulate imports in\nthe same way the EU does. The minister added that most of the factories already registered are from the\nEU.\n\n\u000cCACTUS FRUIT “TEEN SHOKI” BACK ON THE STREETS OF EGYPT:\n\nCactus fruit, or prickly pear fruit, (teen shoki in Arabic) is back on the streets of Egypt. Street vendors\nhave a special technique for peeling and putting the pears inside plastic bags. This makes it safe to buy\nthem from carts, unlike some other food served on the streets. The price of one fruit this season is EGP\n1.50 compared to EGP 1.00 last year, about US 16 cents ($1 = EGP8.88). Total production area for this\nJune/July fruit, all of which is for local consumption, is about 3,000 acres and produces around 30,000\ntons. The fruit has high levels of antioxidants and potassium, and is a very good source of vitamin C, B1\nand B2.\n\nAgricultural Numbers\n\n\nEgyptian Government purchased 480,000 metric tons of foreign wheat: Ministry of Supply\nand Internal Trade’s General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC) purchased 480,000\nmetric tons of wheat from Russia, Romania and Ukraine in two tenders announced in July 2016.\nThese are the first two global tenders announced by GASC in the new fiscal year budget and\ncame after the end of the government’s procurement of local wheat.\n\n\n\nEgyptian Government plans to grow 147,000 HA of cotton in 2017: Ministry of Agriculture\nand Land Reclamation announced that it plans to cultivate 147,000 HA of cotton in 2017. Only\n50,000 HA were planted with cotton in 2016 while the government was expecting at least\n100,000 HA to be planted.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Nile Nuggets for July 2016_Cairo_Egypt_7-24-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_7-15-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-21-2016.txt\nCrop update - France weighs heavy on otherwise positive prospects_London_United Kingdom EU-27_7-20-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Buenos Aires_Argentina_7-18-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Jakarta_Indonesia_7-28-2016.txt\nRussian Agricultural Policy and Situation Bi-Weekly Update - 10_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-20-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_Dhaka_Bangladesh_8-5-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\nRenewed Temporary Export Ban on Some Hides and Skins_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-22-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nGrain and Feed Update_New Delhi_India_7-28-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nDraft SPS Measure to WTO_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nJordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\n","title":"Nile Nuggets for July 2016_Cairo_Egypt_7-24-2016.txt","summary":"EGYPT REJECTS U.S WHEAT SHIPMENT DUE TO ERGOT CONTAMINATION: Egypt’s\nthat the shipment had levels of ergot fungus that breached international and local wheat standards.\nergot fungus in wheat shipments has been an ongoing cause for controversy in Egypt as CAPQ was\nnew policy as it restricts trade between the two parties, James Moran, EU ambassador to Egypt, told\nEgyptian Government purchased 480,000 metric tons of foreign wheat: Ministry of Supply\nmetric tons of wheat from Russia, Romania and Ukraine in two tenders announced in July 2016.\nEgyptian Government plans to grow 147,000 HA of cotton in 2017: Ministry of Agriculture","keywords":"wheat","latentTopics":"egypt, wheat, eu, ministry, fruit, percent, government, agriculture, ergot, report"}

Bales\nArea and Production\nFAS Mumbai revised the cotton area forecast for MY 2016/17 to 11.2 million hectares which is almost\na 6 percent reduction from the previous year. Despite a good monsoon, farmers have shifted area to food\ncrops. This is attributed to expected market revenue, support, and policy advocacy issued by central and\nstate governments to plant pulses, oilseeds, maize, and other agro-forestry products. In addition,\nfarmers report concern with persisting pest pressures and rising input costs.\nThe drop in planted area will be partially offset with anticipated higher yields, but not enough to\nincrease overall production. As such, the FAS Mumbai production forecast is 27 million 480 lb. bales\n(34.5 million 170 kg bales/ 5.86 mmt) which is a 500,000 480 lb. bale reduction from the USDA official\nforecast. For MY 2016/17, crop yields are estimated at 524 kg/hectare, slightly higher than three year\naverage.\nNorth India\nAccording to the state government of Punjab, planted area in 2016 is 256,098 hectares. This is a 42\npercent reduction from MY 2015/16. Historically, Punjab was responsible for 4 percent of total cotton\nacreage. Last season the Punjab cotton area was affected by whitefly infestations and officials indicate\n\n\u000cthat the pest pressure was responsible for turning out the lowest ever cotton crop yield in the state. This\nyear, the Punjab government advised farmers to finish planting cotton before May 15 or risk creating\nconditions favorable for whitefly breeding. Fear of pest infestations, lack of pre-monsoon rains, and\nlimited access to irrigation water discouraged farmers from planting cotton in the area. Sources\nsuggested and recent FAS Mumbai travel confirms that farmers planted pulses and maize and as\nirrigation water was released, opted to plant rice.\nDuring recent FAS Post travel, the cotton crop was at an early flowering stage. The crop indicated the\npresence of whiteflies, but the levels were below the threshold level of 6-8 whiteflies per leaf to cause\nalarm. Weekly advisories published by Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) – the nodal agency\nfor cotton research – indicated whitefly incidence in certain Punjab districts and recommended\ninsecticide and weeding control measures.\nCotton planting in Haryana concluded for the year and is estimated at 496,522 hectares. The area is 14\npercent lower than last year. Overall, area shifted to pulses (pigeon pea) and maize, but farmers in some\ndistricts have continued planting cotton due to a lack of alternatives as the delayed monsoon restricted\nfarmer options. According to the Haryana Agriculture Department, area under non-Bt cotton cultivation\nincreased from 3 percent to 7 percent in 2016. In most areas, the crop was in the square and boll\nformation stage and farmers were focused on weeding operations.\nIn Rajasthan, the pace of planting is higher than last year, but overall area is expected to be lower as\nfarmers shift area from cotton, soybeans, and cluster bean (Guar) to pulses and cereals.\nCentral India\nFAS Mumbai forecasts Gujarat planted area to be lower than last year by 14 percent. As of July 29,\n2016, sowing in Gujarat reached over 2.0 million hectares. The state has received below normal (i.e.,\ndeficit) rainfall during the monsoon in most of the cotton growing districts. Recent FAS travel to\nGujarat indicated that a large area shifted away from cotton to groundnut and pulses. The delayed\nmonsoon left farmers with limited water for irrigation and spraying, but there are no pest incidences\nreported. Though yields are expected to be higher than last year when the crop was affected by the pink\nbollworm, the crop yield is forecast to be lower than the five-year average.\nIn Gujarat, farmers report shifting towards groundnut and pulses as these crops result in greater price\nrealization and are considered less risky with a shorter crop cycle, reduced irrigation requirements, and\nhave much lower input costs. Weather forecasts indicate more than 45 percent deficit rainfall in the\nthree districts covered during the Post crop survey. While precipitation levels have been below normal,\nforecasts through mid-August indicate light to moderate rainfall.\nAccording to CICR advisories, farmers were advised not to plant any cotton after July 15, as a late sown\ncrop will need to be managed for pink bollworm infestations. Farmers are being advised to monitor for\npink bollworm, remove and destroy crop residues/ground cover, and install pheromone traps.\nFAS Mumbai forecasts the cotton area in the state of Maharashtra to be higher than last year as the\ncotton growing districts have received excess rainfall; especially, in eastern Maharashtra. Recent FAS\ntravel to the region indicated favorable crop conditions with adequate soil moisture and no pest\npressure. As of July 29, 2016, planted area reached 3.62 million hectares. Other crops with increased\n\n\u000cplanted area included soybean and pulses.\nArea in Madhya Pradesh is expected to be higher than last year as farmers shift area to cotton from\nsoybean. Floods in Madhya Pradesh affected the central and eastern parts of the state while the cotton\ngrowing districts in western Madhya Pradesh received normal rainfall.\nSouth India\nIn Telangana, though planting continues, the cotton planted area as of July 29, 2016 was lower by 26\npercent from last year. FAS Mumbai forecasts area in Telangana to be lower by 12 percent from last\nyear once sowing is complete. The major cotton growing districts in northern Telangana received excess\nrainfall, but the sowing is slower than last year as farmers shifted to rice, maize, and pulses (red gram\nand green gram). The state government discouraged farmers from planting cotton and encouraged a shift\nto alternate crops such as soybeans.\nIn the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh, favorable weather conditions have led to higher cotton\nplanting area across cotton growing districts. Cotton is at the sowing to vegetative stage. There are also\nlarge area increases under rice, pearl millet, pulses (red gram and black gram), groundnut and other\noilseeds (including, sesame and castor).\nIn Karnataka, the cotton area is slightly lower than last year as the area has increased land to pulses\n(tur), maize and sorghum. FAS Mumbai forecasts the cotton area in Karnataka to be lower by 2 percent\ncompared to last year. The cotton crop in most districts of Karnataka is at a seedling stage, while cotton\nis in a boll development stage in the state of Tamil Nadu where area is expected to remain unchanged.\n2015 Crop Arrivals Near Complete\nCotton Corporation of India (CCI) arrivals by July 27 reached 26.17 million 480 lb. bales (33.52 million\n170 kg bales/5.69 mmt). Arrivals are almost 99 percent of the total MY 2015 production estimate of the\nCotton Advisory Board with another two months remaining in the season. CCI is estimated to be\nholding around 19,520 480 lb. bales (25,000 170 kg bales). In MY 2015, CCI procurement under MSP\nprogram was around 659,126 480 lb. bales (844,163 170 kg bales /143,508 mt).\nOn July 16, 2016, the Ministry of Textiles issued a press release informing that the recent spurt in cotton\nprices has resulted in higher input costs for the spinning sector. Consequently the Cotton Corporation of\nIndia will sell its existing stock, purchased under MSP, to spinning mills in the Micro, Small and\nMedium Enterprises (MSME) category only. This would be for such MSME spinning textile units\nregistered with the Office of Textile Commissioner. For details refer here. Small mills typically do not\nhave the capacity to maintain stocks and procure small quantities of cotton on a daily basis. Keeping in\nview the current market prices, CCI has been mandated to sell its remaining stock to these small units.\nCotton Advisory Board revised MY2014 \u0026 MY2015 estimates\nOn July 13, 2016, the Cotton Advisory Board (CAB) revised the MY 2014 and MY 2015 cotton balance\nsheet. FAS Mumbai has updated the area and production estimates to reflect the CAB figures for MY\n2014 and MY 2015.\n\n\u000cTrade\nFAS Mumbai MY 2016/17 exports are forecast at 4.5 million 480 lb. bales (5.7 million 170 kg bales/\n980,000 mt). Exports in MY 2016 are expected to be lower than MY 2015 as buyers in traditional\nmarkets of Pakistan and China look towards their respective domestic supplies for consumption. Indian\nmerchants and exporters however are increasingly diversifying trade to newer markets such as\nIndonesia, Taiwan, Turkey and Thailand though their dependence on Bangladesh and Vietnam remains\nhigh.\nFor MY 2015, exports are forecast unchanged from the USDA official estimate at 5.8 million 480 lb.\nbales (7.42 million 170 kg bales/ 1.26 mmt) based on trade data (refer table 2a). In June almost half of\nthe total cotton shipments exported were from ports in Gujarat. Shipments mostly consisted of the\ncurrent year’s crop of 29 mm Shankar-6. Top export destination for June shipments were Bangladesh\nfollowed by Vietnam and China.\nThe FAS Mumbai MY 2016/17 import forecast is 1 million 480 lb. bales (1.2 million 170 kg bales/\n218,000 mt). Trade sources indicate large orders have been placed for imported cotton as domestic\nsupplies tighten and the available domestic cotton is priced higher than imported cotton.\nIn MY 2015, imports are forecast at 1.025 million 480 lb. bales (1.31 million 170 kg bales/ 223,000 mt)\nbased on trade data (refer table 3). June imports consisted of large volumes of West African cotton (45\npercent) followed by American pima cotton (28 percent) and the new 2016 Australian cotton crop (11\npercent). July shipments were slightly higher than the previous month. More than 65 percent of\nimported shipments were destined for southern India indicating mills needed to cover their near term\nrequirements. Most shipments into southern India were West African cotton (70 percent) followed by\nAmerican and Australian cotton.\nConsumption\nFAS Mumbai forecasts MY 2016 consumption slightly higher than the USDA official forecast at 24.2\nmillion 480 lb. bales. With global demand for cotton products not keeping pace with man-made fibers,\nconsumption is expected to be essentially flat from the previous marketing year.\nSince August 2015, seed cotton prices have climbed 44 percent. In addition, ginned cotton prices rose\n31 percent from 68 cents per pound in August 2015 to 89 cents per pound. Industry sources report this is\naffecting the profitability of the industry. As a result, mills will need to import cotton from the world\nmarket rather than wait for the Indian crop that is harvested in late October. Small to medium-sized\nmills that typically don’t have coverage for more than a few weeks report that they are not sourcing\ndomestically as buying at current prices is not viable. Instead, these small and medium-sized mills are\nopting to import from West Africa, United States and Australia.\nBased on a year-on-year comparison of textile consumption data, there is a reduction of 1 percent from\nthe August to May period. The average monthly consumption for 2015 remains at 1.9 million 480 lb.\nbales (2.49 million 170 kg bales). Even the most traded 30s count spun cotton yarn prices since October\n2015 have risen by 19 percent.\n\n\u000cMinimum Support Price for Cotton Increased by 1 percent\nOn June 1, 2016, the Government of India announced the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and bonus\nfor Kharif crops for the MY 2016/17 season. To promote planting, bonuses were announced by\nGovernment of India for pulses and oilseeds. The MSP and bonus for pulses resulted in an average\nincrease of 8 percent while the MSP and bonus for oilseeds resulted in an increase of 5 percent over\nprevious MSPs. The MSP increase for cotton was 1 percent.\nTable 1: India.

The\nshare of the total payment directed towards livestock will be 3.2 billion TL ($1.07 billion), with 1\nbillion TL ($333 million) for calf subsidies. Note that these estimates assume an exchange rate of\nUS$1=3 TL, although the actual rate is quite variable. The important updates on 2016 subsidies are to\nmerge fuel subsidy and fertilizer subsidy into one payment and to abolish soil analysis subsidy which\nwas previously granted to producers benefiting from the fertilizer subsidy. The subsidies for calves\nincreased while the subsidies for dams were removed. The subsidies for dams were previously the main\nsupport for producers. According to livestock sector, the calf subsidy was increased in order to boost\nthe cattle population and to close meat deficiency in Turkey.\n\n\u000cLivestock Subsidies\nThe Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock (MinFAL) plans to grant 11.6 billion TL ($3.87\nbillion) in agricultural subsidies to producers in 2016. The share of the total payment directed towards\nlivestock will be 3.2 billion TL ($1.07 billion), with 1 billion TL ($333 million) for calf subsidies. Note\nthat these estimates assume an exchange rate of US$1=3 TL, although the actual rate is quite variable.\nThe specific rules for the subsidies are determined by the Communique on Implementing Rules\nRegarding Livestock Subsidies which is republished each year by Ministry of Food, Agriculture and\nLivestock (MinFAL) (updated Communique No: 2016/26).\nAccording to the Decree on 2016 Agricultural Subsidies, livestock subsidies will be paid directly to\nproducers. Roughly 2 percent to 3 percent of those total payments will go directly to Associations.\nBefore 2016, all subsidies were given to Associations in order for them to distribute to producers.\nThe important updates on subsidies are to merge fuel subsidy and fertilizer subsidy into one payment\nand to abolish soil analysis subsidy which were previously granted for producers benefiting from the\nfertilizer subsidy. The sector believes that producers will face problems with choosing appropriate\nfertilizers for their farms if soil analysis subsidies are abolished. Fishing vessels subsidies remain the\nsame as in 2015.\nThe subsidies for calves increased while the subsidies for dams are removed. The subsidies for dams\nwere previously the main support for producers. According to livestock sector, MinFAL increased the\ncalf subsidy in order to boost the cattle population and to close meat deficiency in Turkey. The subsidy\naims to prevent calf losses. Also, the sector believes that calving period in Turkey is longer than in EU\ncountries and needs to be shortened. With the new subsidies to calves, they believe the period will be\nshortened and programs of one calf in one year will be implemented.\nCalf subsidies: In order to improve cattle number inventory in Turkey and to decrease calf losses in\ncattle herds, calves raised at a facility for at least four months are subsidized. The calves must be born\nin 2016 and registered in the TURKVET and e-improvement database. E-improvement database\nregisters cattle animals into system and is jointly operated by MinFAL and Cattle Breeders’ Association\nof Turkey (CBAT). TURKVET is a database operated by MinFAL and registers cattle animals, breeders\nand facilities in Turkey within the scope of Implementing Regulation published by MinFAL on\nidentification, registration, and supervision of cattle animals.\nHerd-book calf subsidy: The subsidy is provided for the calves of the dams registered in the eimprovement system and inseminated in Turkey 210-295 days before the date of calf birth. Insemination\ndetails should also be in the e-improvement system.\nCalf of buffalo: Buffalo calves raised at a facility at least for four months are subsidized. The calves\nmust be born in 2016 and registered in the TURKVET database.\n\n\u000cRaw milk subsidies: With the difference of new Decree, raw milk subsidy will not be granted to\nproducers who produce raw milk without a contract and do not register their contract into Milk\nRegistration System. Additionally, producers must sell their milk to Milk and Meat Board (ESK) or\nmust produce powder milk within scope of a contract with ESK. Those amendments are made according\nto the milk surplus situation in Turkey. For further information; please see GAIN report date: 5/4/2016\nNo: TR6024 or here.\nBreeding female sheep/goat subsidies: The subsidy given to breeding sheep and goat increased in\n2016. Sheep/ goat breeders who are members of the Breeding Sheep-Goat Breeders Associations and\nwhose animals are registered to KKKS (Sheep/Goat Registration System) and KKBS (Sheep/Goat\nInformation System) can benefit from this subsidy once a year for each breeding female animal.\nBreeding female animals must be born on 1st of September 2015 or before.\nAngora goat and mohair production subsidies: In 2016, this new subsidy will be granted to angora\ngoat producers who sell their mohair to Mohair Selling Cooperatives or to breeding sheep and goat\nbreeders associations.\nFeeder male cattle subsidy: 200 TL per head is granted to breeders for up to 300 head of animals who\nslaughter their male cattle (including buffalo, registered on the Ministry’s database, born within the\ncountry and have finished their feeder period) in the slaughterhouses complying with the national\nlegislation.\nThe other important update on Subsidy Decree of 2016; forage plants subsidies are increased. Also\nthe subsidies for the establishments free from diseases are reduced.\nBelow are the values of the subsidies (Note: 1 decare= 0.247 acre):\nNo\n\nFuel and Fertilizer Subsidy\n\nUnits for Support\n(TL/decare)\n11\n\n1\n\nFuel and Fertilizer\n\nNo\n\nOrganic Apiculture Subsidy\n\n1\n\nHive with bee\n\nNo\n\nCalf including calves of buffalo Subsidy\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nCalf at 4 months old and older\nHerd-booked calf (for 81 provinces)\nProgeny tested calf (Additionally)\n\nNo\n\nSilkworm Subsidy\n\nUnits for Support\n(TL/hive)\n10\n\nUnits for Support\n\nUnits for Support\n(TL/head)\n350\n500\n50\n\n\u000c(TL/unit/kg)\n50\n40\n\n1\n2\n\nSeed (box) (unit)\nWet Cocoon (kg)\n\nNo\n\nApiculture Subsidy\n\n1\n\nHive with bee\n\nNo\n\nForage Crops Subsidy\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nAlfalfa (succulent)\nAlfalfa (dry)\nTrefoil\nAnnual forage\nAnnual forage for silage\nCorn for silage (succulent)\nCorn for silage (dry)\nArtificial meadow-pasture\n\nNo\n\nApiculture Subsidy\n\n1\n\nBombus bee\n\nNo\n\nWaste Subsidy(*)\n\nNo\n\nEstablishment free from diseases Subsidy(**)\n\nNo\n\nVaccination Subsidy\n\nUnits for Support\n(TL/unit)\n10\nUnits for Support\n(TL)\n60/ decare/year\n35/ decare/year\n45/ decare/year\n40/ decare\n55/ decare\n90/ decare\n45/ decare\n150/ decare\n\nUnits for Support\n(TL/colony)\n60\n\nUnits for Support\n(TL/head)\nCattle Waste (after vaccination)\n400\n1\nSmall Ruminant Waste (after vaccination) 100\n2\n*Payments are made after vaccination only implemented by MinFAL.\nUnits for Support\n(TL/head)\nEstablishment free from disease\n200\n1\nSubsidy for Approved Milk Establishment (additionally) 60\n2\n**All cattle excluding breeding males and males aged up to 6 months in dairy facilities having health\ncertificate that shows the facility is free from diseases.

Bret Tate\nPrepared By:\nMohamed Khraishy\nReport Highlights:\nThe Jordan Food and Drug Administration is banning the use of partially hydrogenated oils in dairy\nproducts. The measure was implemented on June 2, 2016 following media coverage and public debate\non the issue. By the end of 2016 domestic production and imports of these products will be eliminated.\nPartially hydrogenated oils are known to be a major source of trans-fats and some studies show that they\nmay have negative impacts on human health.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nJordan will completely ban the use of hydrogenated oils in dairy products by 2017. A recent decree by\nthe Jordanian Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) requires that only animal fat occurring naturally in\ndairy products be permitted in milk and cheese. The ban on hydrogenated oils will apply only to dairy\nproducts, which are considered a staple of the Jordanian diet. Processed dairy products containing\nhydrogenated oils will no longer be produced in, or imported to, Jordan. These oils can still be used in\nthe production of chips, chocolate and other products. The new measure was implemented on June 2,\n2016.\nThe ban is based on JFDA standards 185/2009, 246/2006 and 393/2012, as well as the new decree\npublished in the official gazette (No. 5394) on May 2, 2016. This measure replaced the Jordan\nInstitution for Standards and Metrology (JISMO) standards 1605/2004 and 1520/2004, which\npreviously regulated the use of partially hydrogenated oils.\nThe debate on partially hydrogenated fats was sparked by a television talk show earlier this year. The\nprogram noted the danger of using the hydrogenated fats in processed cheese. Subsequently, both the\nJISM and JFDA rushed to implement new regulations corresponding to the US FDA and World Food\nSummit recommendations. A study on the side effects of trans-fats was presented at the World Food\nSummit in Rome in 2015. The study showed that partially hydrogenated oils were the most important\ndietary source of industrial produced trans-fat. Furthermore, the study noted that these substances have\nserious consequences for human health, specifically cardiovascular health.\nFollowing the May 2nd decision, the JFDA informed local dairy manufacturers of the decision to ban the\noils. Jordanian manufacturers of processed dairy products were not allowed to import the partially\nhydrogenated oil as of May 2nd. Importers of food products fiercely opposed the ban noting their\ncontractual obligations with foreign suppliers. Faced with commercial realities, JFDA extended a grace\nperiod until December 31st for those firms that can demonstrate preexisting contracts for the banned\nproduct. As of January 1, 2017 the ban will be final for all importers and dairy manufacturers.\nIn spite of the ban on partially hydrogenated oils used in dairy products, the oils can still be used in the\nproduction of chips, chocolate and some other products. Dairy is considered a staple of the Jordanian\ndiet and is treated as a sensitive product.\nUS cheese exports to Jordan grew from zero to US $5 million from 2010 to 2015. Exports are expected\nto nearly double to US $10 million in 2016. US producers who export to Jordan are strongly encouraged\nto label their dairy products as containing no trans-fats. If the label or ingredients have any percentage\nof vegetable oil, Jordanian customs authorities will potentially reject the shipment.\n\n\u000c","similarList":"Jordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt\nGVN issues Decree sanctioning violations in plant quarantine_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-25-2016.txt\nNew Biotechnology Regulations Maintain Status Quo _Lima_Peru_7-27-2016.txt\nGovernment Reforms its Infant Milk Formula Program Effective August _Cairo_Egypt_7-26-2016.txt\nDraft SPS Measure on Dog Semen Notified to WTO_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-22-2016.txt\nDraft SPS Measure to WTO_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nMARD phases out of growth promotion usage of antibiotics in feed_Hanoi_Vietnam_7-6-2016.txt\nRussian Agricultural Policy and Situation Bi-Weekly Update - 10_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-20-2016.txt\nRenewed Temporary Export Ban on Some Hides and Skins_Moscow_Russian Federation_7-22-2016.txt\nNew Romanian law on food trading triggers adjustments in the supply _Bucharest_Romania_8-4-2016.txt\nTurkey Composite Products Guidelines Subject to Veterinary Controls_Ankara_Turkey_8-3-2016.txt\nEU Decides on New 500 Million Farm Crisis Aid Package _Brussels USEU_EU-28_7-19-2016.txt\nTurkish Livestock Support and Subsidies Update 2016_Ankara_Turkey_7-26-2016.txt\nMeat TRQs for Kazakhstan-2nd stage_Astana_Kazakhstan - Republic of_8-9-2016.txt\nCacao for Peace (CFP) Overview_Bogota_Colombia_7-28-2016.txt\nThe WASABI - Hot News from Japan Vol. 12 Issue 6_Tokyo_Japan_7-22-2016.txt\nNew Zealand Wine Sector Report for 2016_Wellington_New Zealand_8-10-2016.txt\nRegulations relating to the reduction of sodium in certain foodstuff_Pretoria_South Africa - Republic of_7-26-2016.txt\nFinal Amendment on Food Product Standards and Labeling Regulations_New Delhi_India_8-8-2016.txt\nFood Processing Ingredients Bulgaria_Sofia_Bulgaria_8-3-2016.txt\n","title":"Jordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products_Amman_Jordan_8-4-2016.txt","summary":"Jordan bans partially hydrogenated oil in dairy products\nThe Jordan Food and Drug Administration is banning the use of partially hydrogenated oils in dairy\nPartially hydrogenated oils are known to be a major source of trans-fats and some studies show that they\nJordan will completely ban the use of hydrogenated oils in dairy products by 2017.\nJordanian manufacturers of processed dairy products were not allowed to import the partially\nIn spite of the ban on partially hydrogenated oils used in dairy products, the oils can still be used in the\nto label their dairy products as containing no trans-fats.","keywords":"products production product","latentTopics":"hydrogenated, dairy, oils, jordan, partially, ban, fats, trans, jordanian, jfda"}

Minister-Counselor\nPrepared By:\nSun Young Yoo, Market Promotion Specialist\nReport Highlights:\nIn 2015, total Korean imports of seafood were $4.24 billion, up 1.9 percent from 2014 due to rising\nprices. Imports of American seafood increased by 4.9 percent to $233 million, making the United\nStates the fourth largest exporter with a market share of 5.5 percent. U.S. seafood is generally\nconsidered high quality and safe, but less price competitive when competing with other origins. By\nvolume, Alaska Pollack Surimi, flatfish, frozen Alaskan Pollack, Cod, Alaskan Pollack roe, Monkfish,\nray, Pacific salmon, Hagfish, Atka Mackerel, lobster, etc. are some of the major species imported in\nlarge quantities from the United States. By value, Alaskan Pollack Surimi, lobsters, flatfish, live\nHagfish, Monkfish, frozen Alaskan Pollack, Cod, Alaskan Pollack roe, skate, and frozen Hagfish were\nthe top ten imported species.\n\n\u000cExecutive Summary:\nGeneral Information:\nSECTION I: KOREAN SEAFOOD MARKET OVERVIEW\nIn 2015, Korea’s seafood imports from all origins amounted to $4.24 billion, up 1.9 percent from\n$4.16 billion in 2014. The United States was the fourth largest exporter of seafood products to Korea.\nThe largest seafood supplying country in 2015 was China at $1.1 billion, followed by Russia at $705\nmillion, Vietnam at $574 million, USA at $233 million, Norway at $218 million, Thailand at $168\nmillion, Japan at $116 million, Taiwan at $102 million, Peru at $99 million and Chile at $97 million.\nThese ten countries accounted for 81 percent of Korea’s total seafood imports in 2015. The most\npopular seafood imported in volume was Alaskan Pollack, followed by Alaskan Pollack Surimi, squid,\nMonkfish, flatfish, Alaskan Pollack fillets, Cod, Alaskan Pollack roe, Atka Mackerel, ray, Rock Fish,\nskate, etc. Value-wise, the most popular seafood was Alaskan Pollack Surimi, followed by Alaskan\nPollack fish, Monkfish, live lobster, Alaskan Pollack, flatfish, squid, Alaskan Pollack fillet, Cod, live\nGlass Eel, skate, ray, Atka Mackerel, Rock Fish, frozen lobster, etc.\nKorea imported $233 million of U.S. seafood in 2015, up 4.9 percent from $222 million in 2014,\ngiving the United States a steady market share of 5.5 percent. In Korea, U.S. seafood, including\naquaculture, is generally considered high quality, but higher in price compared to that of competing\ncountries. Until 2011 the United States had been the fifth largest exporter of seafood to the Korean\nmarket following China, Russia, Vietnam and Japan, but in 2012 Japan turned its rank over to the\nUnited States due to Korean consumers’ withering demand for Japanese seafood products after the\nnuclear power plant accident in Fukushima. In 2015, the U.S. maintained its market position with\nincreased sales performance of its seafood products compared to 2014. Alaska Pollack Surimi, live\nlobster, flatfish, live Hagfish, Monkfish, frozen Alaskan Pollack, Cod, Alaskan Pollack roe, Skate,\nfrozen Hagfish, frozen lobster, ray, Atka Mackerel were the top thirteen species imported in large\nquantities from the United States, and increased value of U.S. seafood exports to Korea can be partially\naccounted for by frozen fish Surimi ($60.2 million, up 7 percent), frozen flatfish ($24.6 million, up 6\npercent – increased demand by institutional feeding sector), live Hagfish ($12.3 million, up 11 percent –\nrising market price), Monkfish ($11.6 million, up 14 percent – increased demand from restaurants),\nfrozen Alaskan Pollack ($10.9 million, up 57 percent – reduced import from Russia and benefits from\ncustoms-free product under the KORUS FTA TRQ system have focused attention on U.S. Alaska\nPollack), frozen lobster ($4.6 million, up 51 percent – increased demand by lobster sandwich\nrestaurants).\nTables 12-1 and 12-2 of Section V below show the major species exported to Korea from the United\nStates and the world. Imports of those 29 fish species accounted for more than 92 percent of the total\nimports of fishery products from the United States in 2015.\nUntil 2000, Korea was a net exporter of seafood. However, growing domestic demand and limited\nsupplies have reversed the situation. In 2015, Korea exported $1.48 billion of seafood and imported\nabout $2.76 billion more than it exported. Imports are expected to continue to outpace exports ensuring\nthat Korea will remain an important market for premium U.S. seafood suppliers.\n\n\u000cSECTION II: KORUS FTA AND CUSTOMS DUTY\n\n\nKORUS FTA\n\nWith respect to the seafood sector, the KORUS FTA is expected to create more opportunities for U.S.\nseafood exporters. Customs duties for fishery products imported from the United States were cut to\nzero immediately, or will be phased out over the course of 3 to 10 years. For instance, the customs duty\nfor frozen Sockeye Salmon was cut to zero immediately. In contrast, customs duties for U.S. trout and\nsea bass will be reduced to zero in 3 and 10 years, respectively. The customs duty elimination will be\nprorated equally every year over the phase-out period.\nThere are three fish species which are subject to Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQ) under the FTA. For\ninstance, customs duties are zero for imports of 2,082 metric tons of frozen flatfish and for 5,646 metric\ntons of frozen Alaskan Pollack in 2016. The quantities shall enter on a first-come, first-served basis.\nThe duty-free quantities will increase each year as shown in the table below.\nTable 1.

Production from adjacent waters remained the same as that of 2014,\nand production from distant waters decreased by 13.6 percent. To the contrary, productions from\nshallow sea aquaculture and inland waters were up 7.4 percent and 10 percent each, maintaining the\nstatus quo of overall seafood production. The decrease in production from distant waters in 2015 had\nbeen forecast by the industry well in advance because 2014 production had atypically increased due to\nan unusually high squid catch. It is expected that Korean domestic fish production volume will not\nincrease significantly in the future due to reductions in fish resources in adjacent waters and the\nenforcement of Exclusive Economic Zones by Korea's neighboring countries. Constraints built into\nbilateral and multilateral fishing accords will further impact total harvest. The harvest from adjacent\nwaters fisheries consists primarily of squid, mackerel, corvina, hairtail and anchovy. Government\nefforts to boost aquaculture production in shallow sea areas clearly indicate the importance of this sector\nas a future seafood resource.\nThe number of fishing vessels has steadily decreased reflecting the reduction in fishery resources. To\ncope with this situation, the Korean government has accelerated the downsizing of the Korean fishing\n\n\u000cfleet and plans to reduce it further over the next several years. Recognizing the potential economic\nimpact of this step and the reduction in fishery agreements, the Korean government is undertaking an indepth study of aquaculture and researching how to secure higher fish catch quotas in foreign waters and\nis working hard to purchase fish quotas from other countries, including Russia.\nAs seafood export opportunities with China, the EU and Japan grow, the Korean government is also\nfocusing on aquaculture in shallow sea areas to cope with the shortage of fishery resources in the\nadjacent water and restrictions in neighboring countries’ waters. Shallow sea aquaculture is expected to\ncontinue to increase in the future due to the government’s plan to have the country’s annual seafood\nexport reach $10 billion by the year 2020.\nTo insulate select domestic seafood producers from imported products (mainly from China), the Korean\ngovernment has set higher “adjustment tariffs” ranging from 22 to 50 percent for nine fish species\nwhich are not subject to tariff bindings under WTO agreements. Prior to implementation of the\nadjustment tariffs, imports of these nine species were subject to tariffs ranging from 10 to 20 percent.\nHowever, the Korea-China FTA implemented as of December 20, 2015, will give rise to the surge of\nprice-competitive and good quality Chinese seafood into the Korean market.\nKorean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) established 338,827 metric tons as the Total Allowable\nCatch (TAC) for 2016 of eleven species as shown in Table 4 below. There are further restrictions such\nas limited catch seasons for some species as well as restrictions on the number of fishing boats and\nfishing methods.\nTable 4.

Overall performance of the Korean seafood market\nwill depend greatly on production and consumption. Due to the shortage of ocean resources, seafood\nproduction is not expected to increase in the near future. Despite this, consumption of seafood\ncontinues to grow as consumers view seafood as a healthy source of protein.\nPrice, quality and timeliness are the most important factors affecting U.S. trade. U.S. fish are generally\nconsidered to be high quality and, in turn, more expensive than other countries products. Fortunately,\nthe major species imported from the United States are species that Koreans enjoy and that other origins\ndo not supply in large quantities.\n\n\u000cThe Korea Rural Economic Institute reported in its 2013 Food Balance Sheet that annual per capita\nseafood consumption in Korea was 53.8 Kg (fishery products and shellfish = 36.4 kg and seaweed =\n17.4 kg) in 2013. The major seafood species that Koreans consumed are anchovy, shrimp, squid, tuna,\nAlaskan Pollack, mackerels, yellow corvina, saury, hair tail, flat fish, monk fish, eel, rock fish and cod,\netc. The success of Korean industry efforts to change consumer perceptions of fish (as a healthy\nalternative to red meat), to diversify fish products, to improve quality, and to develop processing\ntechnology will be key in expanding domestic demand.\nThanks to increased income and improved standards of living, seafood family restaurants have grown in\npopularity in Korea. They are expanding their businesses due to a good business climate over the\nyears. Todai, Ocean Seafood, Bono-Bono, Seafood Shangrilla, Marisco, Makinochaya, Fisher’s\nMarket, Sea-n-More, Seafood Blue, Del Kumara, El Mareta, Seafood Kitchen, Ocean Star, D’ Maris,\nMuscus, and Viking’s Wharf are popular seafood family restaurants. These restaurants are using\nimported seafood as well as locally produced seafood.\nKoreans eat fish in various states: fresh fish, chilled fish and lastly, frozen fish in the order of\npreference. Some fish are consumed raw (“Hoi”, or “Sashimi”), and commands a price premium.\nKorean consumers assume fresh fish tastes better than frozen fish after cooking. Accordingly, fresh or\nchilled fish tend to be substantially more expensive than frozen fish.\nAs more and more women are working outside the home, the demand for convenience food has\nincreased. Korean consumers are more attracted to precooked, prepared and preserved food available at\nsupermarkets.\nIn 2013, CJ (Cheil Jedang) Corporation launched a new processed seafood brand called “Alaska\nSalmon”. The “Alaska Salmon” is a canned salmon product that uses natural salmon from Alaska, a\nregion that is famous with its pristine waters. The price of a can is 3,600 Korean Won for 135 grams\nwhich can be converted to about $13.40 per pound. Even though the price is more than two times\nhigher than those of regular canned tunas, this 100 percent Natural Salmon product hit the market\nmaking $9.5 million in sales in the first year with a market share of 68 percent. Stimulated by this\nsuccessful launching of “Alaska Salmon” brand, competing canneries such as “Dongwon” and “Sajo”\nalso introduced their canned salmon products taking 32 percent of the market share. CJ Corporation,\nthe market leader, diversified its canned salmon products by adding three new products in 2014 and\ncurrently five varieties of product (Original, Olive Oil, White Mayo, Brown Rice Oil, Hot Pepper) are\nbeing sold in the market.\nHotels and department stores generally use high quality seafood for which they charge a higher price\nand some of the five-star hotels and leading department stores have already done special promotions\nfeaturing U.S. seafood products such as lobsters and scallops commemorating the 3rd and 4th\nanniversaries of the KORUS FTA implementation.\nHowever, the institutional feeding and food service sector generally uses cheaper food ingredients to\nreduce cost as much as possible to cope with the fierce competition in the sector. The most popular fish\nproducts in this market area include frozen flatfish, skate, croaker, Atka mackerel, Alaska Pollack roe\nand snow crab.\nTable 8.

Major suppliers of fishery products\nto Korea include China, Russia, Vietnam, USA, Norway, Thailand, Chile, Japan, Peru and Taiwan. In\n2015, the top ten supplying countries accounted for about 81 percent of total Korean seafood imports on\na value basis. China continued to be the largest supplier, followed by Russia and Vietnam.\nA dozen supplying countries including China, Russia, Japan, Norway, Thailand, Chile, Canada,\nIndonesia, etc. are some of our competitors that participate in the Busan International Seafood \u0026\nFisheries Expo annually. These competitors exhibit a wide variety of seafood products targeting\nimporters, wholesalers, distributors, retailers, hotels, restaurants and food processors. In 2015,\ncompetitors such as Norway, Canada and Japan have put considerable amount of strategic effort into\npromoting their own country’s seafood export to the Korean market through NSC (Norway), Trade\nCommissioner Service (Canada) and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \u0026 Fisheries (Japan) executing\nmarket research projects and market promotional events in Korea.\n\n\nMarketing\n\nImports of seafood are relatively straight-forward compared to other food and agricultural products.\nTraders import fishery products, and generally sell to hotels and food service industry directly, and/or\n\n\u000cto distributors who sell to traditional markets and restaurants. When the volume is large, importers\ngenerally sell to retailers such as supermarkets, discount stores and department stores directly. When\nthe volume is small, importers sell to distributors who sell to retailers. Accordingly, U.S. suppliers\nshould contact seafood importers to sell their fishery products to Korea.\nConsumers like to purchase species that they are accustomed to, and importers tend to import the\nspecies consumers are demanding. As mentioned earlier, imports of only 29 species accounted for more\nthan 90 percent of total seafood imports from the United States to Korea in 2015. This means that U.S.\nexporters should supply the species consumers prefer, and at the same time should also try to invest in\nbuilding demand for other species with which consumers currently lack familiarity.\nPossible sources of market information include Korean importers, U.S. state departments of agriculture,\nthe USATO website (www.atoseoul.com) and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Lists of Korean\nimporters, by species, can be obtained from the U.S. Agricultural Trade Office.\nOne way of finding potential importers while also assessing market potential is to participate in local\nfood shows to showcase your products to a larger audience. Many Korean importers attending these\nshows are looking to establish reliable long-term trading relationships. Show participation enhances\ninitial contacts with importers, agents, wholesalers, distributors, retailers and others in the food and\nbeverage industry.\nSeoul International Seafood Show (3S) 2016 was held in Seoul at COEX, April 6-8, 2016. Sponsored\nby the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) of Korea, this is the only show held in Seoul\nspecializing in seafood, fishery, nursery, aquaculture, processing machinery and related equipment.\nThis show is held in April every year and targets seafood buyers, users, fishing businessmen and\ntraders. Check the official website of the show (www.seoulseafood.com) for further details.\nBusan International Seafood \u0026 Fisheries Expo (BIFSE) 2016 will be held in Busan at BEXCO\nconvention center, October 27-29, 2016. It offers an excellent opportunity to explore possible market\nopportunities in Korea. This show had been held in November (or October) every year and targets\nimporters, wholesalers, distributors, retailers, hotels, restaurants, food processors, media, etc. Currently\nit is the only seafood show held in Korea attended by ATO Seoul. ATO Seoul has been participating in\nthis show for 12 years, in cooperation with SRTGs such as SUSTA and Food Export USA Northeast.\nCheck BISFE’s official website (www.bisfe.com) for detailed information on the show.

In November 2015, The National Inter-Professional Peanut Committee of\nSenegal (CNIA) announced the MY 2015/16 minimum in-shell peanut price at 200 F CFA ($0.33 per\nkg). Only 40,000 tons of peanuts were collected by the four peanut processing companies, while\n340,000 tons were exported to China (65 percent) and 33 percent to Vietnam. However, peanut actors\nestimate the 2015/06 production between 500,000 tons and 600,000 tons. The shortfall of raw peanut for\nprocessing could reduce the amount of animal feed needed in the country as 25 percent of the in-shell\npeanut waste is used for feed.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\nThe Government of Senegal (GOS) estimates MY2015/16 peanut production at 1.067 million tons, a 58\npercent increase compared to the previous year’s output. Peanut oil processing companies were only\nable to collect 40,000 tons, while 340,000 tons were collected to be exported mainly to China (65\npercent) and Vietnam (33 percent) markets. The competition among buyers was quite stiff. Foreigners\nwere able to offer better prices to farmers than domestic processing companies despite a minimum farm\ngate price fixed in November by the National Inter-Professional Peanut Committee of Senegal (CNIA)\nat 200 F CFA ($0.33). In June 2016, post visited the region of Kaolack to meet with peanut actors and\npeanut processing companies, who estimated the MY 2015/16 peanut production between 500,000 tons\nand 600,000 tons.\n\nProduction\nFor the MY 2015/16 peanut season, subsidized peanut seeds were distributed on time but fertilizers\nwere delayed. The rainy season was favorable. Rains arrived on time and lasted until November.\nHowever, farmers noted a decrease in production due to unexpected heavy rains, late delivery of\nfertilizers, and low seeds quality. Nevertheless, the Government of Senegal (GOS) estimated a 21\npercent yield increase (0.9 tons per hectare) and 29 percent increase in area planted (1.135 million\nhectares) compared to the previous year.\nGOS estimates peanut production for MY2015/16 at 1.067 million tons, a 58 percent increase compared\nto the previous year’s output, and announced the distribution as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350,000 tons for local consumption\n50,000 tons for farmers’ stock\n150,000 tons in post-harvest loss\n40,000 tons collected by the four peanut oil processing companies (COPEOL, SUNEOR, WAO,\nand CAIT)\n340,000 tons for exports\n125,000 tons for subsidized seeds\n\nFor MY 2016/17, the Senegalese government forecasts peanut production at 1.140 million tons, and\nallocated over 100 billion CFA ($53 million) to support the forthcoming campaign. Projects to be\nfunded include:\n\n\n\n\n75,000 tons of certified and improved planting seeds (14 billion CFA)\n94, 000 tons of fertilizer (14 billion CFA)\n20,000 small equipment units (80 billion CFA)\n\nPage 2 of 9\n\n\u000cIn May 2016, the magazine Jeune Afrique announced that Senegal received $20 million from the\nInternational Development Association (IDA) from the World Bank that aims to help the poorest\ncountries produce certified seeds production and sell peanut. More than 850,000 peanut producers,\nincluding 40 percent of women, will benefit from the program. In Senegal, the program will be\nimplemented by the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (PPAAO).\n\nMarketing\nIn November 2015, the National Inter-Professional Peanut Committee of Senegal (CNIA) announced\nthe in-shell farmer’s minimum peanut price at $0.33 per kg, the same price the previous year. The\nmarketing campaign started in November 16, 2015. More than 2,000 collection points were established\nfor all peanut produced in three regions (Diourbel, Kaolack, and Ziguinchor). The Government and the\nCNIA approved 600 operators to buy peanut from the collecting points and sell them to oil processing\ncompanies (SUNEOR, COPEOL, CAIT, and WAO).\nThe campaign ended in May and operators were only able to collect 40,000 tons of peanuts for the oil\nprocessing companies. Most of the peanut were sold in the export market which offered better prices\n(315 F CFA ($0.53) per Kg).\nIn 2009, the GOS opened the peanut export market due to surplus production of one million tons. The\nChinese government expressed its willingness to buy Senegalese peanut on the condition they meet all\nits sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. It took three years (2011-2014) for both governments to\ndevelop and sign an agreement.\nFor more details, visit https://www.google.com/#q=G%2FSPS%2FGEN%2F1461\nAt the beginning of the MY2015/16 campaign, the Government of Senegal (GOS) announced it will\nensure domestic peanut oil processing companies have enough supply before satisfying the export\nmarket. However, processors had difficulty buying peanuts due to the higher demand than expected.\nPrices increased quickly and processors could not meet the market price.\nThe Government of Senegal (GOS) estimates MY 2015/16 peanut export at 340,000 tons, with China,\nthe major buyer having 65 percent of the market share, followed by Vietnam (33 percent).\nThe peanut collected by the four peanut oil processing companies are as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\nCOPEOL collected 19,100 tons before prices increased considerably\nWest African oil (WAO); 13,000 tons\nSUNEOR, which used to be the major oil processing company; 7,100 tons\nComplexe agroindustriel de Touba (CAIT) ; 262 tons\n\nSUNEOR used to be the largest peanut oil company in Senegal. It has been involved in the peanut\nsector for over 30 years with 200,000 tons of peanut processed in 2007. The company produces and\nsells peanut oil under the “Niani” label. It was part of the Advens holding until November 2015, when\nthe GOS took it back until it finds a new owner.\n\nPage 3 of 9\n\n\u000cCOPEOL, the second peanut processing company merged with NOVASEN in 2013. It is a joint\nventure between the two groups Castel and Sophiproteol. COPEOL produces crude oil for the\ninternational market and export in-shell peanut as well.\nComplexe Agro-Industriel de Touba CAIT is the third largest peanut processing company that was\ncreated in 2004 but started oil production activity in 2009. Its production capacity is 35,000 tons, but it\noperates below that level. CAIT sells its refined peanut oil production in Senegal, under the Diwline\nlabel. It also supplies private distributors under the “Tin’or” or “Pod’or” labels. Part of its refined\npeanut oil production is also exported.\nThe West African Oil LLC (WAO) company is a U.S. company. It began its first peanut processing\nactivity in MY 2015/16, processing 13,000 tons due to lack of raw material.\nSimilarly, other processing plants in the region are operating at a minimum level due to insufficient\npeanut stock. Peanut processors estimate the MY2015/16 peanut production between 500,000 to\n600,000 tons. The competition between the processors and the exporters has been difficult as the\nimporters offer better prices than the processors could afford. Therefore, farmers prefer to sell to\nexporters and have a better margin.\nPeanut oil processing companies are exploring possible solutions to the price problem. Some ideas\nbeing considered include:\n\n\n\n\n\nworking closely with the farmers at the beginning of the season by supplying them with inputs\n(seeds, fertilizers) as loan and have them pay back by selling them their production equivalent to\nthe amount borrowed\nProducing peanut. One of the peanut oil processing company has already requested land in order\nto produce its peanut\nNegotiating with the GOS to ensure they get enough supply before opening the export market\n\nPost has been told that exporting a large stock of peanut would prevent the country from producing\nenough animal feed since 25 percent of in shell peanut is processed into feed.\nTrade\nIn MY 2015/16, 83 exporters have been registered but only 46 exporters were active. The Ministry of\nAgriculture (MoA) developed some requirements for peanut exporters in MY 2015/16. Exporters should\nhave:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan agreement delivered by the Ministry of Agriculture via the National Plant Protection Office\n(NPPO)\na phytosanitary certificate delivered by the NPPO after the peanut being controlled by one of the\n50 packaging centers for SPS issues\na verification letter to certify the conformity of the packaging issued by the Director of Internal\nTrade issues\nan attestation of fumigation\na certificate of origin delivered by the Senegalese Agency for Export Promotion (ASEPEX)\n\nPage 4 of 9\n\n\u000cGovernment of Senegal (GOS) estimates MY 2015/16 peanut exports at 340,000 tons and reported\nChina as the major buyer with 65 percent of the market share, followed by Vietnam (33 percent).\nIndonesia, Morocco, Congo, Egypt, Malaysia, Mali, and Cote d’Ivoire shared the remaining (2 percent).\nThe Global Trade Atlas reports 100,000 tons of peanut exported during CY2015 and 119,000 tons\nexported between January and April 2016.

The 2015/16 MY\nraisin production was revised downwards to 49,000 MT based on the impact of rain damage to grapes in\nearly 2016 during the harvest period and the diversion of some grapes to the wine cellars. The 2014/15\nMY raisin production was revised downwards to 60,537 MT based on final industry data at the back of\nexcellent weather conditions, expansion of area planted and the diversion of wine grapes to raisins\nproduction as a result of lower prices for wine grapes. The production figures are based on the dried\nraisin weights.\nRaisins are mainly produced along South Africa’s longest river, the Orange River in the Northern Cape\nProvince, due to its ideal climate for drying raisins. Grapes used for the production of raisins are mainly\nproduced further east of the Orange River, and are harvested later than table grapes, usually from\nJanuary to March in order to maximize the sugar content in the grapes. In the 2014/15 MY, the\nThompson seedless were the most produced raisin cultivar in South Africa, accounting for 52 percent of\ntotal production followed by Goldens (33 percent), Sultans (9 percent) and Currants cultivars (6\npercent). The Thompson seedless raisin is the cultivar of choice because it is suitable for various drying\nmethods.\nThere are seven major raisin processors in South Africa, namely, Bokomo Foods, Red Sun Raisins,\nCarpe Diem Estate, The Raisin Company, Fruit du Sud, Northern Cape Raisins and Farmers Pride.\nFigure 1: South Africa raisin production since the 2006/07 MY\n\nSource: HORTGRO, *Estimate, ** Forecast\nArea Planted\n\n\u000cPage 3\n\nThe 2016/17 MY area planted to grapes for raisin production is forecasted to reach a peak of 16,600\nhectares based on the increase in investment in the horticulture sector driven by the weaker rand to the\nU.S dollar, as well as increases in area planted of the Merbein seedless variety. The Merbein Seedless\nvariety is becoming more attractive to producers as its production is evenly spread out during the season\nand has high yields. Post revised upwards the 2015/16 MY area planted with raisins to 16,117 based on\nupdated industry estimates. The 2014/15 MY area planted to raisins remains unchanged at 15,835 ha.\nFigure 2 shows that the area planted with grapes for raisin production has been growing since the\n2007/08 MY.\nFigure 2: South Africa Raisin Area Planted since 2008\n\nSource: HORTGRO\n*Estimate, ** Forecast\nConsumption\nPost forecasts that the South African consumption of raisins will remain flat at 8,000 MT in the 2016/17\nMY, based on the available raisin crop and slow economic growth in South Africa. The 2015/16 MY\nand 2014/15 MY domestic consumption of raisins was revised downwards to 8,000 MT and 7,906 MT,\nrespectively, based on the decrease in production and updated industry data.\nThe baking industry is still the largest consumer of raisins in South Africa for products like biscuits,\ncakes, and buns that are consumed during festive times such as Christmas, Easter and Ramadan. Sweet\nsultana are ideal for baking while the golden –yellow sultana are sweet-sour and well suited for salads\nand cooking. Raisins are also consumed as snacks, and it is foreseen that the demand for raisins as a\nsnack will continue to improve as consumers’ preferences are moving towards more healthier and\nnatural choices. However, domestic consumption of raisins in South Africa is largely influenced by\navailable supply, prices, competition from fresh table grapes and consumers income growth.\nStocks\n\n\u000cPage 4\nSouth Africa usually has minimal or no closing stocks at the end of each marketing year as raisin\nproduction is largely contracted and considered sold at the end of the season. Post forecasts that there\nwill be no closing stocks in the 2016/17 MY and 2015/16 MY.\nExports\nPost forecasts that South Africa`s raisin exports will increase by five percent to 43,400 MT in the\n2016/17 MY, from 41,450 MT in the 2015/16 MY based on the increase in production. The 2014/15\nMY exports remain unchanged at 52,935 MT based on Global Trade Atlas (GTA) data at the back of\npeak production levels in South Africa.\nEurope remains South Africa’s largest market for raisins accounting for almost 55 percent of the export\nmarket share. Other important markets include Algeria (13 percent), Canada (10 percent) and the\nUnited States (9 percent). There are eight countries competing for the world raisin market, namely,\nAustralia, Chile, Greece, Iran, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey and United States. In the Southern\nhemisphere (Argentina, Chile and South Africa), fruit is largely harvested from February to March, with\nnew products coming to market the in late April to May. Greece, Turkey and the United States harvest\ncrops in late August and September, with availability from September.\nTable 1: South Africa raisin exports\nSouth Africa Export Statistics\nCommodity: 080620, Grapes, Dried (Including Raisins)\nYear Ending: December\nQuantity\nPartner Country\nUnit\n2013\n2014\n2015\nWorld\nT\n31,962\n35,041\n52,935\nGermany\nT\n3,919\n4,364\n12,261\nAlgeria\nT\n3,203\n4,967\n6,752\nNetherlands\nT\n3,794\n3,957\n5,247\nCanada\nT\n4,052\n4,525\n5,242\nUnited States\nT\n3,535\n2,139\n4,829\nFrance\nT\n2,625\n2,273\n3,059\nUnited Kingdom\nT\n2,413\n2,088\n2,361\nBrazil\nT\n1,021\n2,196\n1,622\nBelgium\nT\n564\n494\n1,349\nSpain\nT\n327\n506\n1,268\nSweden\nT\n117\n694\n1,173\nDenmark\nT\n345\n288\n669\nAustralia\nT\n677\n796\n616\nPortugal\nT\n185\n266\n547\nNorway\nT\n352\n545\n521\nSwitzerland\nT\n722\n855\n478\n\n\u000cPage 5\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nT\nMalaysia\nT\nFinland\nT\nJapan\nT\nPhilippines\nT\nNew Zealand\nT\nEgypt\nT\nSource: Global Trade Atlas (GTA)\n\n30\n433\n199\n266\n0\n435\n0\n\n82\n261\n287\n352\n79\n514\n74\n\n456\n448\n393\n349\n343\n297\n201\n\nImports\nSouth Africa is not a major importer of raisins as it produces in excess of domestic demand.

In years with high raisin\nproduction, producer raisin prices are usually low, while years with low production are usually\naccompanied by high raisin prices.\n\nTable 3: Historical price trends: Raisins Producer Prices\nRaisins Varieties\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n\u000cPage 6\n\nGoldens\nThompson\nSeedless\nOther Raisins\nAverage\nSource: HORTGRO\n\nR/To\nn\n10,98\n0\n7,300\n8,590\n8,957\n\nR/To\nn\n17,00\n0\n11,50\n0\n11,50\n0\n13,33\n3\n\nR/To\nn\n12,70\n0\n8,800\n10,40\n0\n10,63\n3\n\nR/To\nn\n19,30\n0\n13,00\n0\n16,00\n0\n16,10\n0\n\nR/To\nn\n19,80\n0\n14,20\n0\n16,90\n0\n16,96\n7\n\nR/To\nn\n17,60\n0\n13,80\n0\n16,00\n0\n15,80\n0\n\nR/To\nn\n18,00\n0\n14,15\n0\n16,20\n0\n15,40\n6\n\nR/To\nn\n17,20\n0\n13,12\n0\n15,30\n0\n14,76\n2\n\nPolicy\nThe applicable regulations when importing raisins into South Africa are as follows;\nProcedures to be followed when importing plants and plant products into South Africa;\nhttp://www.nda.agric.za/doaDev/sideMenu/plantHealth/docs/importProcedure.pdf.\nAgricultural product standards Act, 1990 (Act No. 119 of 1990) - Regulations relating to the quality,\npacking and marking of dried fruit intended for sale in the republic of South Africa;\nhttp://www.nda.agric.za/doaDev/sideMenu/foodSafety/doc/localImportRegulations/gg37949_nn653%20\nAPSA%20-%20Regulations%20re%20quality%20etc%20dried%20fruit%20in%20SA.pdf.\nThe Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act (54/1972);\nhttp://www.health.gov.za/index.php/shortcodes/2015-03-29-10-42-47/2015-04-30-09-10-23/2015-0430-09-11-35/category/181-act\nSouth Africa is in the process of amending the regulations relating to the labeling and advertising of\nfoods.

This is a decrease of 1 percent\ncompared to CY 2015, and a 9 percent decrease compared to the average of the preceding ten years.\nGermany is the third-largest importer of cherries in the world, after Russia and China. The majority of\nimports originate in other EU-28 member states. Largest non-EU suppliers are Turkey for sweet\ncherries and Serbia for tart cherries.\n\n\u000cGeneral Information:\n\nProduction:\nGerman total cherry production for CY 2016 is estimated at 48,088 MT. This is the second year in a\nrow with below average production resulting from heavy rains, hail, and frost during flowering.\nCY2016 production is 1 percent below CY 2015, but 9 percent below the average of the preceding ten\nyears. However, this masks a different development in the sweet and tart cherry sector. Sweet cherry\nproduction is estimated at 32,353 MT, an increase of 3 percent compared to CY2015, while tart/sour\ncherry production is estimated at 15,735 MT, a decrease of 8 percent. This is in line with the trend in\nGermany cherry growing toward sweet cherries and away from tart cherries.\nArea\nHarvested area for sweet and tart cherry area is expected to amount to 5,125 and 2,010 ha, respectively.\nFor both, this would be small decrease of 1 percent relative to 2015. While the decline in sweet cherry\narea is likely a result of bad weather, the decline of tart cherry area is the continuation of a long-term\npattern. In the last ten years, tart cherry area has declined by more than 50 percent from 4,200 ha in\n2006 to 2,010 ha in 2016. The decline in area is a result of strong competition from other EU member\nstates. According to German industry sources, other member states such as Hungary and Poland have\nlower production costs and are more competitive than German producers. Germany is more competitive\nfor sweet cherries, since most of the production is for fresh consumption and consumers are willing to\npay a premium for locally produced cherries.\n\n\u000cSource: FAS Berlin based on data from German Federal Office of Statistics (destatis)\nConsumption:\nIn Germany, fresh cherries are considered a seasonal product and stocked in supermarkets mainly\nduring the German marketing season (July/August). In contrast, peaches are stocked year round but are\nhardly grown in Germany. This explains the lower per capita consumption of cherries (2.2 kg)\ncompared to peaches (3.7 kg). Nonetheless, consumption of cherries is twice as high as for plums (1.1\nkg). Consumer preferences clearly trend towards larger sizes (\u003e28 mm). Smaller cherries can only be\nmarketed at a large discount. For example, in the first week of July 2016, the average wholesale price\nfor domestic sweet cherries amounted to 5.31 Euro per kg for larger cherries but only 3.34 Euro per kg\nfor cherries smaller than 28 mm.\nThe use of tart cherries for processing is relatively stable and roughly amounts to 75-90 percent of the\nGerman domestic production. The majority of tart cherries are used for canning (over 80 percent),\nwhile the remainder finds its way into juice production. The percentage of sweet cherries used for\nprocessing fluctuates between 20 and 50 percent depending on the weather during harvest. The better\nthe weather, the lower is the processing share. However, rain damage increases the percentage of that\ngoes into canning and distillation into spirits.\nTrade:\nGermany is the third largest importer of cherries in the world, after China and Russia. German imports\nvary between 45,000 and 70,000 MT of cherries annually; the majority originates from other EU\nmember states, mainly Austria, Italy, and Spain for sweet cherries and Hungary, Poland, and the Czech\nRepublic for tart cherries. The largest non-EU suppliers are Turkey for sweet cherries and Serbia for\ntart cherries. Separate customs codes for sweet and tart cherries were only introduced in 2012. Since\nthen Turkey has increased its market share in German sweet cherry imports from 3 percent to 14\npercent. For 2016, imports are forecast to increase, as Poland, and Serbia, major tart cherry suppliers to\nGermany, and Turkey for sweet cherries report optimal growing conditions.\nGerman Cherry Imports by Origin and Calendar Year (MT)\nCalendar Year\nPartner Country\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nWorld\n59,374 55,126 70,656 60,280 60,609\nIntra EU-28\n55,905 50,010 58,457 51,406 53,588\nExtra EU 28\n3,469\n5,116 12,199\n8,873\n7,021\nHungary\n14,810\n9,898 15,540 16,499 12,693\nAustria\n12,948 14,477 14,289 11,222 12,501\nItaly\n9,016\n5,256\n5,067\n4,384\n5,387\nTurkey\n896\n1,052\n4,067\n4,500\n5,218\nPoland\n1,625\n4,752\n4,984\n1,614\n5,212\nSpain\n5,410\n4,762\n4,536\n5,990\n4,727\nGreece\n1,821\n1,885\n3,236\n2,938\n4,057\nCzech Republic\n3,420\n2,211\n2,069\n1,881\n3,191\nNetherlands\n2,707\n3,314\n3,643\n2,791\n2,966\nDenmark\n545\n975\n2,292\n763\n1,179\nSerbia\n2,121\n3,492\n7,974\n3,730\n1,136\n\n\u000cSweden\n328\nBelgium\n1,160\nOther\n2,567\nSource: Global Trade Atlas\n\n454\n590\n2,008\n\n35\n1,536\n1,388\n\n1,377\n1,064\n1,527\n\n670\n625\n1,047\n\nGermany exports less than 10 percent of its total cherry supply; 5,000 to 9,000 MT in recent years.\nMain destinations are other EU member states such as the Netherlands Austria, the United Kingdom,\nDenmark, and Sweden.
