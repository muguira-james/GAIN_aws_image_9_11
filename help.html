  <h1>Explaination of the Natural Language Processing capabilities of this application</h1>
<p>
This application uses Natural Language processing to extract information from documents.<p>

<p>
These documents should be in <b>pdf format</b>.  The underlying code changes the pdf file into text
and then processes it. The extracted information is injected into the database for review.</p>

<p>
The following information is extracted:</p>
<ui>
<li><b>Summary</b> - A summary of the document.  Currently, this is a 100 word summary of the input
  document.<br/>
</li>
<li><b>Keywords</b> - The document is processed for keywords. Keywords are important or representative
of the entire text. Typically, the keywords are nouns.<br/>
</li>
<li><b>Topics</b> - At a deeper level, the document is also processed to extract topics. Topics are a deeper
semantic representation of the document. Topics capture the meaning within the document
and can be used for further information extraction.<br/>
</li>
<li><b>Similar documents</b> - The document is also compared to a subset of other documents in the FAS GAIN library
in order to documents that are similar to the current document.</li><br/>
</ui>
<br/>
Documents can also be uploaded from the users local drive.  These documents are processed and the extracted
information is appended to the database. <br/>
<b>Note: </b>There is no guarrentee that the uploaded document will have any similarities with
existing the FAS/GAIN library.
